<h3><span>RICHARD ROLLE OF HAMPOLE.</span></h3>

<p>If the following "Notes" do not demand too much of your valuable space,
they may possibly interest the philological reader, and elicit a number
of learned illustrations. They are drawn from a MS. belonging to this
University (Dd. I. 1.), of which the main part is a course of <i>metrical</i>
sermons upon the Gospels throughout the year. The author of most, if not
all, of the pieces, was the famous solitary, Richard Rolle, of Hampole,
near Doncaster, who died in 1348.</p>

<p>1. The first sample I shall give is a curious illustration of the way in
which the preachers of that age were wont to represent the harshness of
the great in their dealings with the poor:</p>

<div class="poem">
     <div class="stanza"> <p>"For wiþ ensample may we se,</p>
      <p> Þ<span class="topnum">t</span> al þis world is but as þ<span class="topnum">e</span> se</p>
      <p>  Þ<span class="topnum">t</span> bremli bariþ on banke wiþ bale,</p>
      <p> And grete fischis etin þerin þ<span class="topnum">e</span> smale.</p>
      <p>    For riche men of þis world ete</p>
      <p>    Þ<span class="topnum">t</span> pore men wiþ traueyle gete:</p>
      <p>  For wiþ pore men fariþ þ<span class="topnum">e</span> king</p>
      <p>  Riht as þ<span class="topnum">e</span> hal wiþ þ<span class="topnum">e</span> hering,</p>
      <p> Riht as þ<span class="topnum">e</span> sturgeoun etiþ <i>merling</i></p>
      <p>  And <i>lobkeling</i> etiþ <i>spirling</i>,</p>
      <p> So stroyen more men þ<span class="topnum">e</span> lesse</p>
      <p> Wiþ worldis wo and wrongwisnesse,</p>
      <p>  All þ<span class="topnum">e</span> ska þ<span class="topnum">e</span> þ<span class="topnum">t</span> lesse sufferin of more</p>

    <div class="stanza">  <p class="author"> Pp. 115, 116.</p></div>
</div>

<p>2. The word <i>keling</i> (cod-fish) occurs again in the following passage,
where the subject of the preacher is the Incarnation of our Lord:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <div class="stanza"><p> "For right as bayt þ<span class="topnum">e</span> hok heliþ</p>
      <p> And so þ<span class="topnum">e</span> gredi keling teliþ,</p>
      <p> so telid Ih&#363;s wiþ flesch &amp; blode</p>
      <p> <i>Gormond</i> þ<span class="topnum">e</span> <i>gredi</i> on þ<span class="topnum">e</span> rode:</p>
      <p> Gormond þ<span class="topnum">e</span> gredi I him calle</p>
      <p>Þ<span class="topnum">t</span> swelewiþ synful soulis alle,</p>
      <p>   Þ<span class="topnum">t</span> neuer is ful but euer redi</p>

      <p>   Þis Gaweyn was hirchid on a hoke</p>
      <p> Þat flesch &amp; bold on Marie toke</p>
      <p> for hirching þ<span class="topnum">e</span> bodi slas</p>
      <p>And so slow Ih&#275; Salhanas." </p></div>

    <div class="stanza"> <p class="author"> P. 193. </p></div>
</div>



<p><a id="At50"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[50]</span> 3. At p. 352. a rebuke is administered to the <i>gourmet</i> in the following
terms:</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p> "Þat oþer gostli ydropicy</p>
      <p>  Is called on Englisch gloteny,</p>
      <p>  þ<span class="topnum">t</span> mekil is vsed wiþ these burgese,</p>
      <p>  þ<span class="topnum">t</span> lyue mekil at hir owne ese.</p>

      <p>  Al schal ben brouht on to his ham</p>
      <p>Beste and foul boþ<span class="topnum">e</span> wylde &amp; tame,</p>
      <p>And yet all þis way not fille</p>

      <p> On þe pore men þinkiþ he nought</p>
      <p> Ne on þ<span class="topnum">t</span> lord þ<span class="topnum">t</span> him der bought.</p>
      <p> Many a mes be forn him stondiþ</p>
      <p> And of ilkon sum þing he fondiþ,</p>
      <p> Of venyson, of gos and gryse,</p>
      <p>  Tarte, <i>blawmanger</i>, and of ryse,</p>
      <p>   Of euerilkon sumwhat he tastiþ</p>
      <p>And so forsoþ<span class="topnum">e</span> his kynde be wastiþ,</p>

      <p>But if þ<span class="topnum">e</span> riche man wolde þinke</p>

      <p>þ<span class="topnum">t</span> his flesch schol rote in molde,</p>
      <p>He wold not bin þerto so bolde."</p>
</div>

<p>4. The following passage is curious in more respects than one:</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p> "This day <i>witsonday</i> is cald,</p>
      <p> For wisdom &amp; wit seuene fald</p>
      <p>    Was youen to þ<span class="topnum">e</span> apostles as þis day</p>
      <p> For wise in alle þingis wer thay,</p>
      <p>  To spek w<span class="topnum">t</span> outen mannes lore</p>
      <p>   Al maner langage eueri whore.</p>
      <p>þei spak <i>latyn</i>, <i>frensch</i> &amp; <i>grew</i>,</p>
      <p>    <i>Saresenay</i>, <i>deuenisch</i> &amp; <i>ebrew</i>,</p>
      <p>  <i>Gascoyne</i>, <i>Pikard</i>, Englisch &amp; Walsch</p>
      <p>  And oþer speche spak þei als."</p>
</div>

<p>5. At p. 372. we have an interesting picture of a nun persecuted by the
rest of the sisterhood on account of her stricter living:</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p> "Hir cher was ay semand sori</p>
      <p>Hir felawis held hir wod forþ<span class="topnum">i</span>,</p>
      <p> And made of hir ful gret skornyng</p>

<h3><span>NOTES AND QUERIES MSS.</span></h3>

<p>The commencement of a new volume appears to be the signal for new
suggestions. May I fire one off as well as others?</p>

<p>In p. 282. of the Third, and in p. 19 of your present volume, you have
printed two MSS. relating to Cromwell, which I sent you. No doubt there
are many MSS. equally, or indeed more curious and interesting, scattered
throughout the country, which would be worthy of preservation in type in
your valuable columns, and which may possibly be so preserved. But what
shall become of the originals? Would not the possessors of twos or
threes of such documents be glad to place them in a safe and useful
repository, where they might be preserved and be made available to all
who take an interest in our history, whether social or political? And
how could this be better effected than by opening a book for their
reception and safe custody at your office; such book to be open to the
inspection of all applicants, under proper regulations; and, when full,
to be deposited in the British Museum as Vol. I. of the
 "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span> MSS.?"</p>

<p>With regard to the two which you have thought worth printing, I would by
far prefer such a mode of disposing of them, to consigning them, as
trifles, to what might prove the bottomless pit of the Museum, or to
returning them to the snug dormitory in which I found them, between the
leaves of Bishop Kennett's <i>History of England</i>.</p>

<p>Should this hint find favour in the eyes of yourself and your learned
correspondents, not only are these at your service, but I might find
another or two to add to them. I think, however, that none should be
admitted into the collection but such as were considered worthy of being
also preserved in print in "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES.</span>"</p>

<span  class="pagenum">[51]</span>[It can scarcely be necessary for us to add that we shall be very glad
to do our part towards carrying out the very sensible and practical
suggestion of our Correspondent. We shall indeed be glad to show the
sense we entertain of the obligations which we, in common with all
lovers of literature in this country, owe to the British Museum, by
aiding in this or any other well connected scheme for enriching that
storehouse of learning, and increasing, if possible, its present
usefulness.]</p>




<h3><span>MS. FRAGMENTS OF OLD POETRY.</span></h3>

<p>I have before me a sheet of vellum, part of old tale or tales in verse,
which has been used as the cover of a manuscript book. I conceive it to
be about the time of Henry VI. Can any of your correspondents, from the
following extracts, give me any information as to the author, or the
work of which it is a part? There would appear to be parts of two tales,
at least.</p>

<h3><span>FOLK LORE.</span></h3>

<h4><span><i>Medical Use of Mice.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Seeing some Queries and Replies on this subject,
I am induced to send you a few extracts from an old book in my
possession (marked "very scarce"), published in 1661. Its title is
<i>Panzoologicomineralogia, or a Compleat History of Animals and
Minerals</i>. By Richard Lovell, St. C. C. Oxon. It treats chiefly of the
medicinal uses of the various objects. I am tempted to tell you the use
of a "unicorne," but confine myself to the mouse.</p>


<p class="blockquot">   "The flesh eaten causeth oblivion, and corrupteth the meat; yet
   those of Chalecut eat them; it is hot, soft, and fattish, and
   expelleth melancholy.... A mouse dissected and applied, draweth
   out reeds, darts, and other things that stick in the flesh....
   Mice bruised, and reduced to the consistence of an <i>acopon</i>
   (what's that?), with old wine, cause hair on the eyebrows....
   Being eaten by children when rosted, they dry up the spittle. The
   magicians eat them twice a month against the paines of the teeth.
   The water in which they have been boiled helps against the
   quinsey. Being boiled and eaten, they help children's pissing in
   bed. The fresh blood kills warts. The ashes of the skinne,
   applied with vinegar, help the paines of the head. The head worn
   in a cloth, helps the headach and epilepsy. The braine being
   steeped in wine, and applied to the forehead, helpeth the
   headach. Used with water, it cureth the phrensy. The heart,
   <i>taken out of a mouse</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">WHEN ALIVE</span>, worne about the arme of a
   woman, causeth no conception. The fillet of the liver, drunk with
   austere wine, helpeth quartans. The liver, rosted in the new of
   the moon, trieth the epilepsy. The<a id="The53"></a>
<span  class="pagenum">[53]</span> dung, is corrosive.
   Given in any liquor, it helpeth the collicke. It looseneth the
   body; therefore some nurses use it for children in
   suppositories(?). It helpeth hollow teeth, being put therein."</p>

<p>There is more of the sort, to the extent of 2-&frac34; closely printed pages.
It should be added that the author quotes authorities, old and new, for
the several facts he adduces. Pliny is a great authority with him, and
Galen is often cited.</p>

<h4><span><i>Legend of Haydon's Gully.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In the parish of Hinton-Blewett, North
Somersetshire, or immediately adjoining it, in the direction of West
Harptree, there is a wooded gorge in the hill-side, through which runs a
small stream, and which is called "Haydon's Gully." I have lately heard
the following tradition respecting it; viz. that a gentleman named
Colonel Haydon, who was accused of high treason, used to spend his
nights under his brother's roof, somewhere in the neighbourhood, and
every morning came and backed his horse into a hole in the bank, where
he spent the day in order to evade his pursuers. You will perhaps agree
with me, that this story, which, if it has any truth in it, probably
refers to Monmouth's days, is worth inquiring into.</p>

<h4><span><i>The Crow Charm and the Lady-bird Charm.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The following charms are
repeated by children throughout Yorkshire and Lancashire, and, I doubt
not, in other parts of the kingdom also. They may be classed with the
"Snail Charms" (Vol. iii., pp. 132. 179.):</p>

<div class="poem">
   <div class="stanza">
      <p>  <i>Crow Charm.</i></p>
</div>
  <div class="stanza">
      <p> "Crow, crow, get out of my sight,</p>
      <p>Or else I'll eat thy liver and lights."</p>
</div>
  <div class="stanza">
      <p>  <i>Lady-bird Charm.</i></p>
</div>
  <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Lady-bird, lady-bird, eigh thy way home;</p>
      <p>  Thy house is on fire, thy children all roam,</p>
      <p> Except little Nan, who sits in her pan,</p>
      <p>  Weaving gold-laces as fast as she can."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>I remember, as a child, sitting out of doors on an evening of a warm
summer or autumn day, and repeating the crow charm to flights of rooks,
as they winked home to their rookery. The charm was chaunted so long as
a crow remained in sight, the final disappearance of them being to my
mind proof "strong as Holy Writ" of the efficacy of the charm.</p>

<p>The lady-bird charm is repeated to the insect (the <i>Coccinella
septempunctata</i> of Linnæus)&mdash;the common seven-spotted lady-bird&mdash;to be
found in every field and garden during summer.</p>

<p>The lady-bird is placed upon the child's open hand, and the charm is
repeated until the insect takes to flight. The warmth and moisture of
the hand no doubt facilitate this, although the child believes fully in
the moving power of the charm.</p>

<p>N.B. The lady-bird is also known as <i>lady-cow</i>, <i>cow-lady</i>, and is
sometimes addressed as <i>cusha-cow-lady</i>.</p>

<h4><span><i>School Superstitions.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Several appear to exist in schools from
generation to generation: do they exist anywhere else? and whence their
origin? For instance "a boy who could not span his own wrist was a
bastard;" "if you said the Lords Prayer backwards, the devil would come
up," &amp;c.</p>

<h4><span><i>The Nightmare.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I recently observed a large stone, having a natural
hole through it, suspended inside a Suffolk farmer's cow-house. Upon
inquiry of a labourer, I was informed this was intended as a preventive
of nightmare in the cattle. My informant (who evidently placed great
faith in its efficacy) added that a similar stone suspended in a
bed-room, or a knife or steel laid under the foot of the bed, was of
equal service to the sleeper, and that he had himself frequently made
use of this charm.</p>

<p>Is this practice common, and in what does it originate?</p>

 <p class="right">  J. B. C.</p>



<h3><span>EAST NORFOLK FOLK LORE.</span></h3>

<p>1. <i>Cure for Fits.</i>&mdash;A similar superstition on this subject to the one
mentioned by D. (Vol. i, p. 11.) is prevalent in this vicinity. Nine or
eleven young men or maidens (an odd number is indispensable) contribute
each a silver coin for the manufacture of the ring. A friend of the
sufferer gives out that he is making a collection for the purpose, and
calls on the parties expected to contribute, and the coins must be given
<i>unasked</i>, to ensure its efficacy. A watchmaker in my parish tells me
that he has made ten or a dozen such rings within as many years, and
that he has full faith in their curative properties.</p>

<p>2. <i>Cure for Ague.</i>&mdash;Being afflicted two years since with a severe
tertian ague, I was solicited, after the usual medical treatment had

lie on a sixpence, made into an electuary with honey. I complied and,
strange to say, a complete cure was effected. Whether the nausea
consequent on such an unpleasant remedy had any effect on the spasmodic
nature of the malady, I cannot say; but the fact is certain, and it is
esteemed a sovereign specific by the Norfolk rustics.</p>

<h4><span><i>Extreme Ignorance and Superstition.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In a large village in
Dorsetshire, not far from the county town, an intelligent man went
recently into the house of a somewhat respectable woman who keeps a
general shop in the village, and who is the mother of a numerous family
and seeing her with a large family Bible open before her, and several of
her children collected around, while she was cutting and paring their
finger nails, and so holding their hands as that their cuttings might
drop on the leaves of the Bible, he asked her why<a id="why54"></a>
<span  class="pagenum">[54]</span> she did this.
Suspecting, by her manner, that she had some object in view, judge of
his surprise, when she replied&mdash;"I always, when I cut the nails of my
children, let the cuttings fall on the open Bible, that they may grow up
to be <i>honest</i>. They will never steal, if the nails are cut over the
Bible!!" Do we not yet require the educator to be abroad?</p>

<h3><span class="bla">Minor Notes.</span></h3>

<h4><span><i>The Word "Repudiate."</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I cannot help following D<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. K<span class="smcap lowercase">ENNEDY'S</span> example,
and calling attention to another word in our language which is
now-a-days, on many occasions, used very erroneously; I allude to the
word <i>repudiation</i>, or rather the verb <i>repudiate</i>.</p>

<p>How frequently does one hear at public meetings such phrases as these:
"I utterly repudiate the idea," "I repudiate the sentiment," "I
repudiate the insinuation." A page might be filled with phrases of this
description occurring in reported speeches of recent date. The word, in
fact, is made by public speakers of "unadorned eloquence" and newspaper
writers, to do duty for such words as to <i>refuse</i>, <i>repel</i>, <i>reject</i>,
<i>abandon</i>, <i>disown</i>, <i>cast off</i>.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I humbly conceive that repudiation means simply a dissolving
of the marriage contract, hence of any contract or obligation and I
believe I may say with safety, that in no standard classical author,
ancient or modern, is the term <i>repudiation</i>, or the verb, <i>repudiate</i>,
used, except in connexion with some <i>obligation</i> expressed, or in
figurative allusion to such obligation. The term, when applied to the
"drab-coloured men of Pennsylvania," is undoubtedly proper; they have
indeed <i>repudiated</i> their debt, and perhaps brought the word and the
thing into vogue; but to use such a phrase as "I repudiate the notion,"
is, I submit, surely to talk nonsense.</p>

<h4><span><i>The First Panorama</i> </span><span>(Vol. iii., p. 526.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;E. N. W. must have made some
mistake in his recollection. Girton was a painter, and may have worked
at the Panorama of London; but the "first Panorama" was by Mr. Robert
Barker. The sketches were made by his son, Henry Aston Barker, when only
a lad aged fifteen. They were taken from the top of the Albion Mills:
they were also etched by H. A. Barker at the same age, and aqua-tinted
by Birnie, and published in six sheets, 22 by 17, a set of which I
possess, with a note of their history, as herein communicated, written
<i>in dorso</i>, long ago, from Mr. B.'s own lips.</p>

<p class="right">     H. T. E.</p>

<p>E. N. W. is correct in saying, that a semicircular view of London from
the top of the Albion Mills, near Blackfriar's bridge, preceded Barker's
panoramas. It must have been painted about the year 1793. I saw it at
the end of that year, or at the very beginning of 1794. But it was not
exhibited in St. Martin's Lane, but in Castle Street, in a rough
building&mdash;not, I believe, erected for the purpose&mdash;at the back of a
small house on the eastern side of that street. Perhaps some other of
your octogenarian readers may recollect its being there, as well as
myself. The scene on the Thames was the water-procession on Lord Mayor's
day.</p>

<h4><span><i>Chaucer and Gray</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 492).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. T<span class="smcap lowercase">HOMS</span> suggests a very
interesting parallel between a line in Chaucer, and Gray's "Even in our
ashes", &amp;c. Gray himself refers to Petrarch as his original, and the
thought occurs in Shakspeare:</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "In me thou seest the glowing of such fire,</p>
     <p> That on the ashes of his youth doth lie."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And Malone, in a note on the passage (<i>Supplement to Shakspeare</i>, 1780,
vol. i. p. 640), adduces the passage in Chaucer quoted by M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. T<span class="smcap lowercase">HOMS</span> as
an illustration. Steevens has mentioned the following passage in Sir P.
Sidney's <i>Arcadia</i> "In ashes of despair, though burnt, shall make thee
live." Compare, also, <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act V. Sc. 2.</p>

<p class="right">     J. O. H.</p>

<p>To the verse,</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "Even in our ashes live their wonted fires,"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Gray has himself appended a note, indicating that it was suggested by
Petrarch, sonnet 169.; and "I will take the poet's word for a thousand
pounds." It was originally written&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
    <p>  "Awake and faithful to her wonted fires,"</p>

<h4><span><i>Burns and Propertius.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;There is a strange inclination to attribute
similarity of sentiment to plagiarism; as if it were almost impossible
for two men of genius to hit upon the same notions, independently of
each other. In Propertius (II. i. 3, 4.) we find&mdash;</p>

   <div class="poem">
 <p>  Non hæc Calliope, non hæc mihi cantat Apollo,</p>
     <p> Ingenium nobis ipsa puella facit."</p>
</div>

<p>In Burns we read&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
    <p>  "O, were I on Parnassus' hill!</p>
     <p> Or had of Helicon my fill;</p>
     <p> That I might catch poetic skill</p>

     <p> <i>My Muse maun be thy bonnie sel'</i>."</p>

accused of stealing from Propertius.</p>

<h4><span><i>Shakspeare in Sweden.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The writings of Shakspeare would appear from
the following fact to be read with as much avidity and delight in Sweden
as in his native country. A translation of his plays by Hagberg,
Professor of Greek in the<a id="in55"></a>
<span  class="pagenum">[55]</span></p>

<p>University of Lund, is now in course of publication. Of this, twelve
volumes have appeared; and although the first edition consisted of no
less than two thousand copies, the whole have been sold off, and a
second edition is in preparation. Professor Hagberg's translation is
most favourably spoken of by those who are qualified to judge of its
merits.</p>

<h2><span class="bla">Queries.</span></h2>


<h3><span>ON THE ELISION OF THE LETTER "V."</span></h3>

<p>Through the medium of "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" I would be permitted to invite
attention to a peculiar pronunciation that has extensively prevailed,
though unnoticed I believe in print, of many words wherein the letter
<i>v</i> occurs between two vowels.</p>

<p>While resident in the country, when a boy, I was struck with the
singular manner in which the names of certain places, having a <i>v</i> so
circumstanced, were pronounced, for the <i>v</i> was wholly silent, and
occasionally the latter vowel also; but as this was chiefly among
uneducated people, I was led to regard it as a provincialism. However,
as I became further acquainted with the names of places, I did not fail
to observe, that it was by no means limited to any particular part of
England. Thus, for example, the provincial pronunciation of Cavendish
(Suffolk) is Ca'endish; of Daventry, Da'entry; of Staverton and Coverley
(Warwickshire), Sta'erton and Co'erly; of Evesham, E'esham; of Davenham
(Cheshire), Da'enham; of Lavington (Lincolnshire), La'enton or Lenton;
of Avebury (Wilts), Abury; of Lavenham and Cavenham (Suffolk), Lanham
and Canham; of Overton (Leicestershire, Westmoreland, and Cumberland),
Orton; and the Principality gives us Aberga'enny for Abergavenny.
Ivilchester has become Ilchester, and Tovecester (now written Towcester)
is pronounced To'ecester; while Hoveden (Yorkshire) is called Ho'eden,
or Howden, as it is now commonly spelt. Similar examples might be
multiplied. Sometimes a succeeding consonant has undergone a change, as
Pe'emsey for Pevensey, and Rochester for Rovecester or Rofecester.
Numerous as the instances are, there has been some apparent caprice in
the matter, not easily explained. For though, as we have seen, Staverton
and Coverley in Warwickshire, and Daventry on the borders of that
county, undergo this change, yet, as far as I can learn, Coventry was
ever free from it; and in the like manner Twiverton in Devonshire is
called Twerton, yet I believe Tiverton was never Terton. There may have
been something in the original forms or meanings of Coventry, Tiverton,
and the like, that occasioned the <i>v</i> to be retained.</p>

<p>Many examples of the omission of this letter might be adduced from
surnames, did space permit; indeed, several of those given above are
surnames, as well as names of places; and some readers may recollect the
change noticed in Selden's <i>Titles of Honour</i>, of Roger Wendover into
Roger of Windsor, the first step having been to write Roger of Windore.</p>

<p>Nor is the practice confined to names. All are familiar with such
contractions as <i>e'er</i>, <i>ne'er</i>, <i>o'er</i>, <i>e'en</i>, and <i>se'nnight</i>. We
have also <i>ill</i> for <i>evil</i>, and the Scotch have <i>de'il</i> for <i>devil</i>, and
<i>e'ening</i> for <i>evening</i>. In like manner have we derived <i>lord</i> from the
old English <i>loverd</i> or <i>louerd</i>; <i>lark</i> from <i>laverock</i> (Anglo-Saxon
<i>lauerc</i>); <i>hawk</i> from the Anglo-Saxon <i>hafoc</i> or <i>hauoc</i>; and <i>head</i>
from the Anglo-Saxon <i>heafod</i> or <i>heauod</i>; for the <i>f</i> or <i>u</i> in
Anglo-Saxon, when representing our <i>v</i>, became subject to this elision.
Time was, too, when <i>shovel</i> was pronounced <i>sho'el</i>, and rhymed with
<i>owl</i>; as is exemplified in the nursery lay of the death and burial of
poor Cock Robin.</p>

<p>Without now attempting to account for this usage of speech, which seems
to imply the prevalence of a former pronunciation of <i>v</i> very different
from the present, I will briefly notice that the like elision is of
frequent occurrence in Latin, chiefly in the perfect tenses and their
derivatives, as <i>amârunt</i> for <i>amaverunt</i>, and <i>audîsset</i> for
<i>audivisset</i>; occasionally, too, in nouns, as <i>labrum</i> for <i>lavabrum</i>;
and also in the compounds of <i>versus</i>, as <i>retro'rsum</i>. It is found, I
may add, in a few French words derived from the Latin, as <i>oncle</i> from
<i>avunculus</i>, and <i>cité</i> from <i>civitas</i>. In the several languages above
mentioned the <i>v</i> between two vowels is also found passing into <i>w</i> or
<i>u</i>, especially after <i>a</i> or <i>o</i>, the second vowel being in such cases
dropped, thus indicating the connexion that existed between <i>v</i> and <i>u</i>,
which letters we know were in times past written indifferently for each
other. The discussion, however, of this connexion is beside my present
purpose.</p>

<p>The Latin contractions that I have adverted to are well known, and often
noticed; and it is remarkable that the manner in which this treatment of
the <i>v</i> has affected the pronunciation and orthography of our own
language, should have almost escaped observation. An acquaintance with
it has been found of service when consulting ancient writings and the
published records; for those who would use such sources of information
with advantage, should be prepared not only to recognise, but also to
anticipate, the various changes which names of persons and places have
undergone.</p>

<h3><span>ANTHONY MUNDY.</span></h3>

<p>A few weeks since some manuscripts were placed in my hands belonging to
the Hon. E. M. L. Mostyn, M. P. (removed from the library at<a id="at56"></a>
<span  class="pagenum">[56]</span>
Mostyn Hall in Flintshire), in order that I might ascertain the
contents; and on looking at them, I discovered a play in the autograph
of Anthony Mundy, with his signature at the end, and the date (supplied
by another hand) of December, 1595. This play, entitled "<i>A Booke of
John a Kent and John a Cumber</i>," seems to have been hitherto unknown to
all the writers on the history of the stage; and its plot and dialogue
appearing to me sufficiently curious to deserve publication, I lost no
time in communicating my discovery to Mr. J. Payne Collier, under whose
able editorship I am happy to learn that the work (by permission of Mr.
Mostyn) will shortly be printed by the Shakspeare Club. The object I now
have in view in making these remarks, is to point out an error relative
to M<span class="smcap lowercase">UNDY</span> (as he spells his own name) which, if not corrected, may
acquire greater circulation than it possesses even at present. In
Warton's <i>History of English Poetry</i>, 4to. vol. iii. p. 292. <i>n.</i>
(printed in 1781), at the close of his biographical account of Mundy, he
makes the following statement: "He [Mundy] collected the arms of the
county of Middlesex, <i>lately</i> transferred from Sir Simeon Stuart's
library to the British Museum;" and this paragraph is copied word for
word by Chalmers (writing in 1812), and inserted in his <i>Biographical
Dictionary</i> under the article M<span class="smcap lowercase">UNDAY</span> (A<span class="smcap lowercase">NTONY</span>). As no record exists in my
department of any such transfer, I was desirous to trace the truth of
this assertion, which the date of Chalmers could hardly have enabled me
to do, had I not fortunately consulted Nichols's <i>Literary Anecdotes</i>,
vol. viii. p. 645., where I found a letter from the Rev. Michael Tyson
to Gough, dated June 10, 1777, in which he mentions the manuscripts then
recently sold at the seat of Sir Simeon Stuart, in Hampshire, and adds&mdash;</p>


  <p class="blockquot"> "A bookseller opposite the Exchange bought an heraldical lot of
   eighteen volumes, big and little, for which he asks twenty
   guineas: among them is Hawes's [<i>read</i> Harvey's] original
   <i>Suffolk Church Notes</i>, and a beautiful <i>Visitation of
   Cambridge</i>."</p>


<p>With this clue I had little difficulty in ascertaining that the eighteen
volumes alluded to were preserved among the <i>Additional Manuscripts</i> in
the British Museum, Nos. 4960-4977., and were probably purchased of the
bookseller named above. I can trace no copy of the sale catalogue of Sir
Simeon Stuart's library; but this library must have belonged to the
third baronet of that name, of Hartley-Maudit, co. Hants, who succeeded
to the title in 1761. The manuscripts in question all belonged in the
reign of Charles II. to Samuel Waker, painter-stainer, in whose
handwriting many of them are, among which is No. 4964, thus entitled:
"<i>Collections of Descents and Armes of the Gentry of Middlesex, whereof
was noe visitation generall of the same County, before that made by Sir
Henry St. George, Richmond Herald [in 1634], except 7 descents of these
are entered in the old visitation of Hertfordshire made in a<span class="topnum">o</span> 1572;
all the rest are the collections of mee</i>, R<span class="smcap lowercase">ICH</span>. M<span class="smcap lowercase">UNDY</span>." It is evident
that this is the volume referred to by Warton and Chalmers; and no less
certain, that, by a careless blunder, the playwright <i>Anthony Mundy</i> has
been confounded with his namesake <i>Richard Mundy</i>, the painter-stainer,
whose voluminous heraldic labours are recorded in the <i>Catalogue of the
Harleian MSS.</i>, Nos. 1529-1534., 1536-1566., 1570. 1571. and 1577. The
Add. MS. 4964. is, in reality, only an incomplete copy by Waker of
Mundy's original manuscript, preserved in MS. Harl. 1551.</p>

<p>I beg leave to annex the three following Queries.</p>

<p>1. Did any relationship exist between Anthony and Richard Mundy?</p>

<p>2. What is the name of the bookseller who lived "opposite the Exchange"
in 1777?</p>

<p>3. Can any copy of the sale catalogue of Sir Simeon Stuart's library be
referred to in existence?</p>

all understand precisely the meaning of the terms "Conservative,"
"Liberal," "Radical," "Peelite," "Protectionist," all of which, with the
exception of Peelite, are equally applicable to things not political;
but Whig and Tory can only be used in this one sense. From whence then

<p>In this epitaph, the first two words are intelligible enough, and allude

princess; but the expression <i>fort une</i> reads somewhat enigmatical, and

it.</p>

<h4><span>22. <i>Unde derivatur Stonehenge.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Antiquaries and topographers generally
(Stukeley and Sir R.C. Hoare included) have been hitherto content to
consider this word as a compound of <i>stan</i> and <i>henge</i>,
Anglo-Saxon;&mdash;that is, "hanging stone." Now this etymology of the word
has always appeared to me very unsatisfactory. The cross stones do not
hang; they lie on the uprights, and are kept in their places by mortice
holes. An ingenious friend of mine has, by what I consider a happy train
of reasoning, arrived at another and a better conclusion. Every one
knows that our German ancestors used the word <i>horse</i> adjectively. And
we still have it so in use to designate many things as the largest of
their kind; as <i>horse-chestnut</i>, <i>horse-daisey</i>, <i>horse-mushroom</i>,
<i>horse-emmet</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c. <i>Horsa</i> and <i>hengst</i> or <i>hengist</i>, are
convertible terms or if any difference, the latter word is used for
<i>stallion</i>. If so, then, is it not reasonable to suppose that the stones
of this Druid temple would provoke the largest idea of magnitude, and
thence be called Stone-Hengst, or more euphoniously,
Stone-henge,&mdash;stallion stones?</p>

<h4><span>23. <i>Marriage of Bishops.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I should feel obliged to any of your
correspondents who would supply me with an example from early Church
history of a bishop or priest marrying after ordination.</p>

<p>Deacons were expressly allowed to marry by the Council of Ancyra; but I
should wish an example of either of the others.</p>

<p>Marriage after priestly ordination is now forbidden by the Greek church,
and since the Council of Trullo bishops must be celibate or continent.</p>

<p>Second Query&mdash;What evidence is there that bishops in early times, if
already married, were obliged to put away their wives? It is said that
St. Gregory Nazianzen's father had children after he was raised to the
episcopate. Can this be proved, and are there other instances?</p>

<p>From the silence of early Church writers as to any difference between
the clergy and laity on this point, I am much inclined to believe that
the Roman requirement of celibacy was then confined to the bishopric of
Rome itself, and the immediately adjoining country.</p>

<p>St. Paul, in 1 Cor. ix.5., says:</p>


   <p class="blockquot">"Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as the
   other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord and Cephas?"</p>


<p class="noindent">implying that he had power to marry even then; and our Saviour speaks of
continence as a gift given only to certain persons. (St. Matthew, chap.
xix. ver. 11, 12.)</p>

value? "<i>Gedruckt zu Frankfurt am Main durch David Zöpffeln zum Eisern

<p>I find this at the end of a curious German translation of Virgil into
verse&mdash;short and easy flowing.</p>

<p>There is a summary in verse, and a quaint engraving to every book. Bound
in wood and leather. It has many odd peculiarities too long to mention.</p>

<p>In the Preface, this is said to be the <i>second</i> edition, that the first
was published "many years ago, by a learned man." It must have been

<p>&mdash;In Diplock's <i>New Guide to Hastings, St.
Leonard, and the Neighbourhood</i>, which, unfortunately, like most other
works of this class, is worse than useless to the architectural visitor,
it is stated that the old church at<a id="old58"></a>
<span  class="pagenum">[58]</span> Fairlight, which was taken
down not very long since, "was a small but ancient structure, apparently
of the early part of the <i>thirteenth century</i>: it consisted of a
chancel, nave, and square tower, and <i>was built of brick</i>."</p>

<h4><span>27. <i>The Leman Baronetcy.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I shall be extremely obliged by any account
as to the succession of the disputed Leman Baronetcy or estates. Sir
William Leman, of Northaw (or Northall), Herts, was, I believe, the last
of that designation, and up to the present time doubts exist as to the
heir male or other descendants, although great property and possessions
are in abeyance or at stake.</p>

what family the following arms belonged: Sa. a lion ramp. or, betw.
three fleur-de-lys ermine. Crest, a sea-horse. Motto, "Fortior vi
virtus."</p>

<p>The above arms are painted on the portrait of a gentleman wearing a
ruff, temp. James I., in the possession of my family, and I am anxious
to ascertain who it represents.</p>

<h4><span>29. "<i>History of Magnetical Discovery.</i>"</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>
for April 1840, I find the following notice:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "Thomas Stephens Davies, Esq., Fellow of the Royal Societies of
   London and Edinburgh, Professor of Mathematics in the Royal
   Military Academy at Woolwich, and Author of the <i>History of
   Magnetical Discovery</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c."</p>

<p>Being interested in all that concerns the late Mr. Davies, I shall feel
much obliged to any one who will state where I can find the <i>History</i>
here alluded to. I may add that I am acquainted with his papers on
"Terrestrial Magnetism," published in the London <i>Philosophical
Transactions</i> for 1835-6; but since they do not much partake of the
character of "History," they can scarcely be the papers intended.</p>

<h4><span>30. <i>George Chalmers.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Can any of your correspondents inform me what
became of the MSS. of the late Mr. George Chalmers?</p>

<p>On the titles of many of the older poets and dramatists of Scotland I
have met with his notes referring evidently to some MS. list of the
lives of such writers in his possession. My inquiry has reference,
therefore, more particularly to the MS. in question, which has not, I
think, been published.</p>

<h4><span>31. <i>Mistake as to an Eclipse.</i>&mdash;</span></h4>

 <p class="blockquot">  "Some," says Meric Casaubon, "have been deceived in the hour [of
   an eclipse], as in the eclipse that happened <i>April 3, 1605</i>;
   about which some very able artists are noted to have mistaken;
   and the reason is given by astronomers how such a mistake might
   happen."</p>

<p>Such is my "Note;" but I cannot just now give the reference. I will
answer for its accuracy. Can any one give some account of that eclipse,
and state the reasons alleged why "such a mistake might happen?"</p>

<h4><span>32. <i>Statue of Mrs. Jordan.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In visiting Chantrey's studio some years
since, in company with a sculptor still living, we received from Mr.
Allan Cunningham a similar account to that which
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. P<span class="smcap lowercase">ETER</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">UNNINGHAM</span>
has given, that is to say, that the design was <i>Stodhart's</i>, of which,
indeed, it bore too certain evidence.</p>

<p>Chantrey was engaged at that time upon a colossal equestrian figure of
Sir Thomas Picton, destined, I believe, for India. On that visit I was
singularly impressed with the gracefulness and beauty of the statue of a
female figure with three children; one was at her breast, and in the
curled head of another at her feet was the mother's hand enfolded. On
the pedestal of the statue was this inscription:</p>

<div class="poem">
    <p>  "Sacred to the memory of Norah Bland."</p>
</div>

<p>I learnt from Mr. Cunningham that this was the statue of Mrs. Jordan,
and was executed for William IV., and that there was some difficulty
respecting its place of reception. What is become of this noble work of
art? The little boy amongst whose curls the mother's hand played, was
the late Earl of Munster.</p>

<h4><span>34. <i>Sir Edmund Ployden or Plowden.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I am desirous of obtaining
information respecting Sir Edmund Ployden or Plowden, who (according to
a tract published at Middleburg in Holland, in 1648, by a writer signing
himself "Beauchamp Plantagenet") received a grant of land from the crown
of England, covering portions of the present states of Maryland,
Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York. Of this province,
which was called New Albion, the grantee was "Lord Proprietor," "Earl
Palatine," "Governor," and "Captain General." Your assistance I venture
to ask, as this is a matter of historical interest here.</p>

<h4><span>35. <i>Pope's Translations or Imitations of Horace</i> </span><span>(Vol. i., p. 230.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;As you have, I hope, very largely increased the number of
readers and contributors<a id="and59"></a>
<span  class="pagenum">[59]</span> since I asked the question above
referred to, and as it has as yet received no answer, I hope you will
allow me to repeat it, in the hope that some of your new correspondents
may be able to tell me what satirical "<i>Imitation of Horace</i>" can have
been, so early as 1716, attributed to Pope?</p>

<p>I would also, on the same grounds, beg leave to repeat another question,
formerly proposed by P. C. S. S. and by myself (Vol. i, pp. 201. 246.):
What is the precise meaning of the last couplet of these lines of Pope:</p>

<div class="poem">
    <p>  "The hero William, and the martyr Charles,</p>
     <p> One knighted Blackmore and one pensioned Quarles,</p>
     <p> <i>Which made old Ben and surly Dennis swear</i>,</p>
    <p>'<i>No Lord's anointed, but a Russian bear.</i>'"</p>
</div>

<p>That Pope had a precise meaning cannot be doubted; but I have never
heard a reasonable guess at what it might be.</p>

<h4><span>36. <i>John Bodley.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Among the Parker MSS. in Corpus Library at Cambridge
is a patent of Queen Elizabeth to John Bodeleigh to print the English
Bible for seven years.</p>

<p>In the list of translators of the Bible in 1611, as given in the
Introduction to Jameson's <i>Glossary of the Holy Scriptures</i>, appears the
name "Burleigh, M.A.," but without any biographical notice, as in the
other instances.</p>

<p>In Burn's <i>Livre des Anglois à Génève</i>, it is stated that John Bodleigh,
the father of the celebrated Sir Thomas Bodley, was one of the
translators of the Bible.</p>

<p>Can any of your readers throw light on the history of either of these
men, or kindly point to any sources of information respecting them?</p>

<h4><span>37. <i>Dr. Thomas Johnson.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Can your readers give me <i>any</i> particulars of
<i>Dr. Thomas Johnson</i>, the editor of <i>Gerarde's Herbal</i>? I do not require
such information as I can obtain concerning him in Wood's <i>Athenæ
Oxonienses</i>, or Pulteney's <i>Sketches of Botany</i>; but I especially wish
for some information relative to his place of burial, and whether there
is any monumental or other record of its whereabout. He died from a
wound he received during a <i>sortie</i> from Basing House on the 14th of
September, 1644.</p>

<h4><span>39. <i>The Latin Termination "aster."</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Can any of your correspondents
tell me why the termination <i>aster</i> is used in a depreciatory sense in
Latin, as <i>poetaster</i>, a bad poet; <i>oleaster</i>, the wild olive;
<i>pinaster</i>, the wild pine? With regard to this latter substantive, I
have seen the mistake made in a descriptive catalogue of the pine
species, of calling this the <i>star pine</i>; but I have no doubt that it
was named <i>pinaster</i>, as inferior to the stone pine, or <i>Pinus pinea</i>,
which embellishes the Italian gardens, while the <i>pinaster</i> flourishes
on the mountains and the sea-coast.</p>

<p>Probably other examples may be found where the terminal <i>aster</i> is used
in a similar sense.</p>

be found? Malone, Dryden's biographer, enumerates seven or eight
portraits, and he states where they were in 1800. I am aware that two
are in the Bodleian Gallery at Oxford, the one stated by Malone "painter
unknown;" and the other alleged to be by Kneller; but I do not consider
the latter to be an original. I wish more particularly to know who has a
<i>half-length</i> original portrait. Dryden was painted by Kneller,
Closterman, and Riley.</p>

<h4><span>41. <i>Inscription on a Claymore out in 1745.</i></span></h4>

Highland army from England in 1746, Prince Charles Edward and his staff
passed through Dumfries, and slept in a house now known as the
Commercial Inn.</p>

<p>After their departure there was found a light claymore, apparently the
property of an officer; and as it was never claimed, it remained in the
house for some years, and ultimately came into my possession. It is
formed of the finest tempered steel, and bears the following very
curious inscription on one side,</p>

<div class="poem">
 <p>    &#9747; GOTT BEWAR DE;</p>

<p class="noindent">and on the other,</p>

<h3><span>DE REBUS SEPTENTRION ALIBUS.</span></h3>

<p>At page 371. of Vol. iii. I addressed a Query as to the best mode of
reaching Iceland. I have since ascertained that the principal
communication with Iceland is from Copenhagen; whence during the season
sail a monthly packet, sundry trading-vessels, and sometimes a Danish
frigate. Danish vessels also call at Hull and Liverpool to load with
salt for Iceland. The Norwegian trade thither has ceased since 1814, and
it has now scarcely any intercourse except with Denmark.<a id="with60"></a>
<span  class="pagenum">[60]</span> A few
dirty smacks of fifty or sixty tons, from the Thames and another place
or two, resort there to fish, they do not go into port. There is no
further mode of reaching that interesting and remarkable island, except
per yacht, or by one of the steam-excursions which are occasionally
advertised in <i>The Times</i>. The Danish steamers mentioned in Murray's
<i>Guide-book</i> have discontinued running.</p>

<p>Murray gives but little respecting, Iceland, but that little is good.
The best book on it that I have met with is, <i>An Historical and
Descriptive Account of Iceland, Greenland, and the Faröe Islands, with
Illustrations of their Natural History</i>, by James Nicol: Oliver and
Boyd, Edinburgh, 1844. It embodies the substance of all the best
information in small space. The last published English visit to Iceland
seems to be that of Barrow in 1835 but a much more recent account has
been published in German by that enterprising lady Ida Pfeiffer, of a
voyage she made there. An interesting statement of the diseases and
sanatory condition of Iceland is found in the <i>British and Foreign
Medico-Chirurgical Review</i> for 1850, vol v., being a notice of a work
entitled, <i>Island undersögt fra lægevidenskabeligt Synspunct</i>, by Dr.
Schleisner, Fellow of the Royal Medical Society of Copenhagen, who went
to Iceland purposely to examine into its medical condition.</p>

<p>Of works on Norway, Murray's <i>Hand-book</i> is the best, and contains a
list of books on Scandinavia published up to 1848. Besides these, there
are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Scandinavian Sketches; or, a Tour in Norway.</i> By Lieutenant Breton,
R.N.</p>

<p>2. Wittich's <i>Visit to the Western Coast of Norway</i>: London, 1848.
Contains accurate physical descriptions of the country.</p>

<p>3. Forester's <i>Norway in 1848 and 1849</i>: London, 1850. Conveys to the
mind an excellent and very complete picture of Norwegian scenery,
travelling, manners and customs, &amp;c., and gives much valuable
information. The plates are very truthful and characteristic.</p>

<p>4. Ross's <i>Yacht Voyage to Norway</i> is not worth much; and</p>

<p>5. Jones's <i>Angler's Guide to Norway</i> is worth less.</p>

<p>6. Barrow's <i>Visit to Iceland by way of Trondhjem in 1834</i> contains much
about some parts of Norway.</p>

<p>Written in Norwegian, and published in Christiania, is a fine work
entitled, <i>Norge Fremstillet i Tegninger</i>, 1848. The "Tegninger" are
lithographs, eighty-two in number, and well executed and the
descriptions are highly interesting. There is also now publishing a
series of coloured plates of the Norwegian costumes, denominated <i>Norske
Nationaldragter tegnede efter Naturen af forskjellige Norske kunstnere,
og ledsagede med en oplysende Text</i>: Christiania, 1850. The plates are
highly coloured, and the letter-press is in Norsk, German, and English.
Mr. Schirmer of Christiania is also publishing a series of magnificent
architectural drawings of the old cathedrals of Norway. There are
several excellent maps of Norway, of which Munch's is the best but the
only geological map is a very large and complicated one in many sheets,
I think by Professor Keilhau. On the botany of Norway there are,
Hartmann, <i>Handbok i Skandinaviens Flora</i>: Stockholm, 1843, and Lund,
<i>Haandbog i Christianias phanerogame Flora</i>: Christiania, 1846. The
Danish pharmacop&oelig;ia is still employed by the Norwegian apothecaries.
On the dreadful disease found in the Bergen-Stift, called <i>Elephantiasis
Græcorum</i>, or <i>Spedalskhed</i>, Doctors Danielssen and Boeck have put forth
a work in French and Norwegian, embodying an immense deal of research
and information, accompanied with an Atlas of twenty-four coloured
plates. They consider this disease to be identical with the leprosy of
Scripture. Their book was published in 1847; and contains references to
every known account of the disease up to that date, in a bibliographical
list of great length. An article upon it, comprehending a short but
complete account of the disease, may be found in the <i>British and
Foreign Med. Chir. Review for 1850</i>, vol. v.</p>

<p>Of Norwegian national songs and music, there are, besides Lindeman's
<i>Norske Field-Melodier</i>, the following publications:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Folke Sange og Melodier, Fædrelandske og Fremmelse, udsalte for
Pianoforte</i>, 1844.</p>

<p>2. <i>Sangsamling for Norske Selskabskredse: udgiven af det Norske
Studenter-samfund</i>: Christiania, 1839. The students of the Christiania
University have much taste for music, and are very fond of singing in
parts and choruses.</p>

<p>3. <i>Scandinaviske Folkesange udsalte for Pianoforte af Niels W. Gade.</i></p>

<p>4. <i>Norske Viser og Stev i Folkesproget. Anden Udgave</i>: Christiania,
1848. This contains forty-three national ballads, mostly in provincial
dialects, and consequently very difficult to translate but, in many
respects, extremely curious, referring to the manners, customs, and
superstitions of the peasantry. The new edition is edited by P. A.
Munch, Professor of History in the University of Christiania. The notes
of some national airs are added at the end.</p>

<p>Professor Munch also published in 1850, <i>Symbolæ ad Historiam
Antiquiorem Rerum Norvegicarum.</i> I. <i>Breve Chronicon Norvegiæ.</i> II.
<i>Genealogia Comitum Orcadensium.</i> III.<i> Catalogus Regum Norvegiæ. E. Codice
quoad magnam partem hactenus inedito, et in orcadibus, ut videtur, medio

considerable: although that of Denmark and of Norway is less known,

<h3><span>HUGH HOLLAND AND HIS WORKS.<br />
(Vol. iii., p. 427.)</span></h3>

<p>M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">OLTON</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY</span> having favoured your readers with "a notice of some of
the statements" contained in my article above-named, I deem it a duty
incumbent upon myself to make a few remarks upon these "notices," which
I shall do in the briefest manner possible.</p>

<p>The object of my paper was to call attention to a forgotten poet, and to
endeavour to obtain some information regarding the locality of his
manuscripts. Had I been writing the life of Hugh Holland, I should, of
course, have investigated the dates of his biography and works more
fully than it was necessary to do for a trifling article like that in
question. But, as it is, the facts and dates which I have given are all
derived from creditable and well-known sources and all the facts and
dates in question are the <i>facts and dates</i> of older writers than
myself, as will appear by the following.</p>

<p>1. "He was born at Denbigh in 1558." He was born at Denbigh, but not in
1558. In 1625 he thus expressed himself:</p>

<div class="poem">
    <p>  "Why was the fatall spinster so vnthrifty?</p>
    <p>  To draw my third four yeares to tell and fifty!"</p>
</div>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Where are these lines taken from, and what do they mean? What
is the proof that they relate to <i>Hugh Holland</i>? "Hugh Holland, an
esquire's son of Denbighshire," was matriculated at Baliol College,
Oxford, anno 1582, aged twenty-four. My authority is Wood's <i>Athenæ</i>,
edit. Bliss, vol. ii. p. 560.</p>

<p>2. He did not quit Westminster school till 1589. If ever he pursued his
studies at Baliol College, it was some ten years afterwards.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Who says he did not quit Westminster school till 1589?&mdash;Joseph
Welch, or M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">OLTON</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY</span>? Allowing it to be the former, are all
Welch's dates correct? I have Wood's authority that Hugh Holland
matriculated at Baliol in 1582.</p>

<p>3. "About 1590 he succeeded to a fellowship at Trinity College,
Cambridge." In 1589 he was elected from Westminster to a <i>scholarship</i>
in Trinity College, Cambridge&mdash;not to a <i>fellowship</i>. At a later period
of life he may have succeeded to a fellowship.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> My words are, "<i>about</i> 1590 he succeeded to a fellowship." M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span>
C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY</span> adds, "In 1589" he was elected to a <i>scholarship</i>. I must again
refer to honest old Wood, who expressly says that he was a <i>fellow</i> of
Trinity College.</p>

<p>4. "Holland published two works: 1. <i>Monumenta Sepulchralia Sancti
Pauli</i>, Lond. 1613, 4to. 2. <i>A Cypress Garland</i>, &amp;c., Lond. 1625, 4to."
Hugh Holland was not the compiler of the first-named work: the initials
H. H. admit of another interpretation.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Why does not M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY</span> give your readers his interpretation
of the mysterious "H. H.?" One Henry Holland was the author of <i>A Booke
of Kings, being the true Effigies of our English Kings</i>, &amp;c.: Lond.
1618, 4to. Is this the interpretation? If so, I ask for the proof.</p>

<p>5. The dates assigned to the <i>Monumenta Sancti Pauli</i> are "1613, 1616,
1618, and 1633." Here are three errors in as many lines. The <i>first</i>
edition is dated in 1614. The edition of 1633, which is entitled
<i>Ecclesia Sancti Pauli illustrata</i>, is the <i>second</i>. No other editions
exist.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> The edition of 1614 was certainly the first, and that of 1633
<i>certainly</i> the second. In the preface to the latter the author says,
"My first collection of these Monumentall Epitaphs I published<a id="Epi63"></a>
<span  class="pagenum">[63]</span>
anno 1614, full nineteen yeeres sithence." My authority, however, for
the "three errors in as many lines" is Cole's Collections for an <i>Athenæ
Cantabrigenses</i>. (See Brydges <i>Restituta</i>, vol. iii p. 215.)</p>

<p>6. "Holland also printed a copy of Latin verses before Alexander's
<i>Roxana</i>, 1632." No such work exists. He may have printed verses before
the <i>Roxana</i> of W. Alabaster, who was his brother-collegian.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> My authority again is Cole's Collections in <i>Restituta</i>, vol.
iii. p. 215, where, under the head of "Hugh Holland, fellow of Trinity
College," is this line: "Has a copy of Latin verses before Dr.
Alexander's <i>Roxana</i>, 1632." I shall therefore leave the shade of Cole
and M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">OLTON</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY</span> to settle the question as to whether any such work
exists.</p>

<p>I have now disposed of the six statements, and have only to add, that
the authorities which I have consulted are those which I have named.</p>

<h3><span>"PRENZIE" IN "MEASURE FOR MEASURE"<br />
(Vol. iii., p. 522)</span></h3>

<p>The suggestion of <i>primzie</i> is too ingenious, and too apparently happy,
to be passed over without adducing some reason for refusing to give it
the preference to Tieck's reading of <i>precise</i>.</p>

<p>The terminal adjuncts <i>zie</i>, <i>sie</i>, <i>some</i>, generally imply some playful
diminutive variation of the original word, certainly they never add
force or gravity to it: <i>prim</i>, in itself, is a diminutive of
<i>primitive</i>, and applies more to external appearance than to internal
character. I do not think, therefore that even <i>prim</i> would be a word
sufficiently dignified for the situation and context; much less is its
diminutive <i>primsie</i>.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the character of Angelo is generally mistaken; he is
too often looked upon as a mere hypocrite, whereas Shakspeare depicts
him, before his fall, as a rigid but <i>sincere</i> ascetic. This view of his
character accounts for his final condemnation of Claudio: he has no
mercy for <i>the crime</i>, even while committing it himself; and he was just
the man who, had he escaped detection, would probably have passed the
remainder of his life in the exercise of self-inflicted penance.</p>

<p>Viewing Angelo, therefore, as a man proverbial for rigidly virtuous
conduct; who stood "at a guard with envy;" who challenged scrutiny; and
who was above the tongue of slander; I do not think that <i>primsie</i> can
be looked upon as an appropriate designation in the mouth of Claudio. He
would use some word in the greatest possible contrast to the infamous
conduct Isabella was imputing to Angelo: <i>primsie</i> would be weak and
almost unmeaning, and, as such, I will not receive it as Shakespeare's,
so long as the choice of a better remains.</p>

<p>Does not Shakspeare, by his frequent repetition of <i>precise</i>, in this
play, seem purposely to stamp it with that peculiar signification
necessary to his meaning, that is, rigidly virtuous? Another example of
it, not, I believe, before noticed, is where Elbow describes his "two
notorious benefactors" as "precise villains," "void of all profanation
that good Christians ought to have."</p>

<p>The humour of this is in the contrast afforded by Elbow's association of
incongruous and inconsistent terms, causing Escalus to exclaim, "Do you
hear how he misplaces?" <i>Precise</i> therefore in this place also requires
a meaning as opposite as possible to villany, something <i>more</i> than
formal, in order that the humour may be fully appreciated.</p>

<p>With respect to Halliwell's quotation from Fletcher's poems, it
certainly confers upon <i>prin</i> a very different meaning from any that
<i>prim</i> is capable of receiving: the context requires <i>prin</i> to have some
signification akin to <i>fleshless</i>; like "bodyes at the resurrection,
just rarifying into ayre." <i>Prin</i>, in this sense, would seem to have
some relation to <i>pine</i>, since <i>pin</i> and <i>prin</i> were synonymous.</p>

<h3><span>THE TEN COMMANDMENTS<br />
(Vol. iii, pp. 166, 230, 412.)</span></h3>

<p>The earliest divisions of the Decalogue are those of Josephus (<i>Ant.
Jud.</i>, lib. iii. c. v. s. 5.), the Chaldee Paraphrase of Jonathan, and
<i>Philo-Judæus de Decem Oraculis</i>. According to the two former, the 3rd
verse of Exod. xx., "Thou shalt have no other gods but me," contains the
first commandment, the 4th, 5th, and 6th, the second. Philo makes the
Preface or Introduction to be a distinct commandment, as do also St.
Jerome and Hesychius. The two latter make what we call the first and
second to be the second only; but Philo does not recite the words "Thou
shalt have no other gods but me;" and whether he understood them in the
first or the second, does not hence appear. The same uncertainty is
found in Athanasius in <i>Synopsi S. Scripturæ</i>.</p>

<p>It may however be inferred, from these two writers giving the
commencement only of the other commandments, that they made the
prohibition, "Thou shalt not make," &amp;c., in the same manner the
commencement of the second; and therefore joined the other, "Thou shalt
have," &amp;c., to the words "I am the Lord thy God."</p>

<p>Those which we call the first and second were united by St. Augustine.</p>

<p>The distinction made by Josephus and the Chaldee Paraphrast, separating
the two prohibitions, was adopted by the following early writers: Origen
(Hom. viii. in Exod.); Greg. Nazianzen<a id="Greg64"></a>
<span  class="pagenum">[64]</span> (<i>Carmina, Mosis
Decalogus</i>) Irenæus (lib. ii. c. xlii.); Ambrose (in <i>Ep. ad Ephes.</i> c.
vi.).</p>

<p>The Jews divide the Decalogue thus:</p>

<div class="poem">
    <p>  1. I am....</p>
   <p>   2. Thou shalt not have....</p>
      <p>3. Thou shalt not take....</p>
</div>

<p>But in the field of speculation, the Jews have followed a variety of
systems for dissecting the Decalogue, as may be seen in Abarvanel in the
Pericope "Jethro," and in Voisin's <i>Pro&oelig;mium ad Martini Pugionem
Fidei</i>.</p>

<p>The following authors may be consulted on the arguments which have been
adduced to support their respective divisions by the Church of Rome and
the Lutherans on the one side, and the Reformers or Calvinists and the
Church of England on the other.</p>

<p>1. Church of Rome.&mdash;Gother's <i>Papist Misrepresented</i>; Godden's
<i>Catholics No Idolaters</i>; <i>Gotti Vera Ecclesia Christi</i>.</p>

<p>2. Lutherans.&mdash;<i>Salmuthi Theses</i>; <i>Winckelmanni Dissertatio, &amp;c.</i>;
<i>Crameri de distinguendo decalogo, &amp;c.</i>; <i>Franzii Disputatio</i>; <i>Weimari
Demonstratio</i>; <i>Opitii Dissertatio de usu accentuationis geminæ in
genuina divisione decalogi</i>; <i>Dasdorfii Dissertatio de decalogo, ex
fundamento accentuum examinato</i>; <i>Hackspanii Notæ Philologicæ in varia
loca S. Scripturæ</i>; <i>Pfeifferi Opera</i> (<i>cent.</i>&nbsp;1.).</p>

<p>3. Reformers.&mdash;<i>Sam. Bohlii vera divisio decalogi ex infallibili
principio accentuationis.</i></p>

<p>In reference to this argument, which is used by both parties, I have
been favoured with the following remarks by a learned professor of
languages, of the Jewish faith:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "On the subject of your inquiry, the accents do not appear to me
   to offer any decision. They show which words are to be connected
   with each other to make up one proposition; but not how many
   propositions shall go to make up one commandment."</p>

<p>4. The Church of England.&mdash;Ussher's <i>Answer to a Jesuit (Images), and
his Sermon preached before the Commons House of Parliament</i>, 1620;
Taylor's <i>Ductor Dubitantium</i> (where, in connexion with the Romish
controversy, this subject is exhausted); Stillingfleet's <i>Replies to
Gother and Godden</i>; and <i>Forbesii Theologia Christiana</i>.</p>

<h3><span>THE REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO.<br />
(Vol. iii., pp. 321. 376.)</span></h3>

<p>Though your correspondent M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">YDNEY</span> S<span class="smcap lowercase">MIRKE</span> has brought to our notice
the existence of the republic of San Marino, and informed us of many
facts in connexion therewith, and though F. C. B. has enlightened us on
several points of interest in the history of this state, still I do not
find in either of these communications the following particulars of its
foundation, which are in Addison's <i>Remarks on Italy</i>, pp. 62, 63. (ed.
Talboys, 1830), and which may interest some of your readers.</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "San Marino was its founder, a Dalmatian by birth and by trade a
   mason. He was employed above thirteen hundred years ago in the
   reparation of Rimini, and after he had finished his work, retired
   to this solitary mountain as finding it very proper for the life
   of a hermit, which he led in the greatest rigours and austerities
   of religion. He had not been long here before he wrought a
   reputed miracle, which, joined with his extraordinary sanctity,
   gained him so great an esteem that the princess of the country
   made him a present of the mountain, to dispose of at his own
   discretion. His reputation quickly peopled it, and gave rise to
   the republic which calls itself after his name.... The best of
   their churches is dedicated to the saint, and holds his ashes.
   His statue stands over the high altar, with the figure of a
   mountain in its hands crowned with three castles, which is
   likewise the arms of the commonwealth. They attribute to his
   protection the long duration of their state, and look on him as
   the greatest saint next the blessed Virgin. I saw in their
   statute book a law against such as speak disrespectfully of him,
   who are to be punished in the same manner as those who are
   convicted of blasphemy."</p>

<h3><span>SHAKSPEARE'S USE OF "EISELL."<br />
(Vol. ii., pp. 241. 286. 329., &amp;c.; Vol. iii., pp. 66. 119. 210., &amp;c.)</span></h3>

<p>After so much has "been said on both sides," in the pages of
 "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>," on the signification of <i>eisill</i> or <i>esil</i> in <i>Hamlet</i>, it
appears to me that the evidence requires to be carefully summed up. This
task I would willingly leave to other hands; but since no correspondent
attempts it, I will venture, if I may be allowed, to take it on myself,
and will strive to perform it to the best of my ability.</p>

<p>The question is, whether by the word under discussion we are to
understand <i>vinegar</i> (or some such liquid) or <i>a river</i>. It will be
proper, in taking a view of the matter, to "begin from the beginning,"
and to see, in the first place, what the earlier commentators have said.</p>

<p>1. What the critics before Theobald thought of the word, is not quite
certain; but Theobald states that it had, "through all the editions,
been distinguished by Italic characters, as if it were the proper name
of a river; and so," he adds, "I dare say all the editors have from time
to time understood it to be." But not being able to satisfy himself what
river could be meant, he preferred to understand it of vinegar, and
interprets the passage, "Wilt thou swallow down large draughts of
vinegar?"</p>

<p>2. Sir Thomas Hanmer, on the contrary, was so convinced that a river was
signified, that he actually altered the passage, <i>arbitrio suo</i>, to</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "Wilt drink up <i>Nile</i>? or eat a crocodile?"<a id="wilt65"></a>
<span  class="pagenum">[65]</span></p>
</div>

<p>3. Johnson was silent, and left the explanation of the word to Steevens,
who, observing that Hamlet meant to rant (as he says he will), supposed
him to defy Laertes "to drink up a river, or try his teeth on an animal
whose scales are supposed to be impenetrable." The word, he thinks, may
be irrecoverably corrupted, but he finds plenty of rivers in Denmark of
a somewhat similar sound, any one of which should "serve Hamlet's turn."</p>

<p>4. Malone, in his first edition, deeming that Hamlet was not speaking of
"impossibilities," but merely of "difficult or painful exertions,"
decided on adhering to Theobald and his vinegar. But in his second
edition he repented, and expressed his conviction that "Mr. Steevens's
interpretation is the true one," remarking that "this kind of hyperbole
is common among our ancient poets."</p>

<p>5. Steevens, before he published his second edition, read the
observations in favour of <i>vinegar</i> given in Malone's first edition but,
though he allowed them to be "acute," was not moved by anything advanced
in them to depart from his opinion that a river was intended.</p>

<p>6. Boswell followed Malone's second thoughts.</p>

<p>7. Mr. Singer, in his edition printed in 1826, had so little notion that
<i>vinegar</i> could be signified, that he does not even advert to a single
argument in behalf of that opinion, attending only to the consideration
"what river, lake, or firth, Shakspeare meant."</p>

<p>8. Mr. Collier makes no decision, observing only that <i>eyesel</i> is
certainly the old word for <i>vinegar</i>, but that there is considerable
doubt whether that be meant here and that "some of the commentators
suppose Hamlet to challenge Laertes to drink up the river Yssell or
Eisell."</p>

<p>9. Mr. Knight favoured the river, remarking that "there is little doubt
that Shakspeare referred to the river Yssell, Issell, or Izel, the most
northern branch of the Rhine, and that which is nearest to Denmark."</p>

<p>Thus we have, on the side of <i>vinegar</i>, Theobald, and Malone's first
edition, on the side of the <i>river</i>, Sir T. Hanmer, Steevens, Malone's
second edition, Boswell, Mr. Singer in 1826, and Mr. Knight; six against
two. I say nothing of Johnson, whom, however, we may consider to have
been favourable to Steevens; or of the earlier editors, who, according
to Theobald, printed the word in Italics as a proper name.</p>

<p>So the matter remained; most readers, as well as critics, being, I
believe, of opinion that a river was intended, until MR. SINGER, in the
46th No. of "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>," revived the notion that some kind of
drink was signified.</p>

<p>10. Let us now consider what testimonies are advanced by the various
critics on behalf of each of these opinions. That <i>eysell</i> (the 4to.,
1604, reads <i>esil</i>, and the folio <i>esile</i>) was used as synonymous with
one kind of drink, viz. <i>vinegar</i>, is apparent from the following
authorities. Malone observes that it occurs in Chaucer and Skelton, and
also in Sir Thomas More, <i>Works</i>, p. 21., edit. 1557</p>

<div class="poem">
                     <p> &mdash;&mdash; "with sowre pocion</p>
     <p> If thou paine thy taste, remember therewithal</p>
     <p> That Christ for thee tasted <i>eisil</i> and gall."</p>

</div>

<p>He also remarks that it is found in Minsheu's <i>Dictionary</i>, 1617, and in
Coles's <i>Latin Dictionary</i>, 1679.</p>

<p>Shakspeare himself, as Farmer was the first to point out, has, in his
111th Sonnet,</p>

<div class="poem">
   <p>   &mdash;&mdash; "like a willing patient I will drink</p>
      <p>Potions of <i>eysell</i> 'gainst my strong infection;</p>
   <p>   No bitterness that I will bitter think,</p>
     <p> Nor double penance to correct correction."</p>
</div>

<p>From Chaucer, Richardson's <i>Dictionary</i> supplies,</p>

<div class="poem">
   <div class="stanza"> <p>  "She was like thing for hunger deed</p>
     <p> That lad her life only by breed</p>
     <p> Kneden with <i>eisel</i> strong and agre,</p>
      <p>And thereto she was lean and megre."</p></div>

<div class="stanza"> <p class="author"> <i>Romaunt of the Rose.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and another passage thus:</p>
 <div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">
     <p>"Then these wretches full of all frowardnesse</p>
     <p> Gave him to drink <i>eisel</i> temp'red with gall."</p></div>

<div class="stanza"> <p class="author"> <i>Lamentation of Mary Magdalen.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Todd, also, in his edition of Johnson, says that the old English <i>aysel</i>
for <i>vinegar</i> is used by Wicliffe.</p>

<p>11. Next comes the consideration whether, if <i>vinegar</i> were intended,
the expression <i>drink up</i> could properly have been used in reference to
it. On this point Theobald says nothing, except intimating that "drink
up" is equivalent to "swallow down." Steevens denies that if Shakspeare
had meant Hamlet to say, "Wilt thou drink vinegar?" he would have used
"the term <i>drink up</i>," which means "<i>totally to exhaust</i>." Malone, in
his first edition, remarks on the subject as follows:</p>


<p class="blockquot">   "On the phrase <i>drink up</i> no stress can be laid, for our poet has
   employed the same expression in his 114th Sonnet, without any
   idea of entirely exhausting, and merely as synonymous to <i>drink</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">
    <p>  'Or whether doth my mind, being crowned with you,</p>
    <p>  <i>Drink up</i> the monarch's plague, this flattery?'</p>
</div>


<p class="blockquot">   "Again, in the same Sonnet:</p>

<div class="poem">
          <p>    &mdash;&mdash; 'Tis flattery in my seeing</p>
     <p> And my great mind most kingly <i>drinks</i> it <i>up</i>.'</p>
</div>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Again, in <i>Timon of Athens</i>:</p>


<div class="poem"> <p>'And how his silence <i>drinks up</i> his applause.'</p></div>

<p class="blockquot">   "In Shakspeare's time, as at present, to <i>drink up</i> often meant
   no more than simply <i>to drink</i>. So in Florio's <i>Italian
   Dictionary</i>, 1598: '<i>Sorbire</i>, to sip or <i>sup up</i> any drink.' In
   like manner we sometimes say, 'When you have <i>swallowed down</i>
   this potion,' though we mean no more than, 'When you have
   <i>swallowed</i> this potion.'"</p>

<p>In his second edition, however, Malone abandoned his first
interpretation, and his remarks on <i>drink up</i> then went for
nothing.<a id="nothing66"></a>
<span  class="pagenum">[66]</span></p>

<p>Discussion on this point has occupied some paragraphs in
 "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>." MR. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span>, in his first paper (Vol. ii., p. 241.), asserts
that "<i>to drink up</i> was commonly used for simply <i>to drink</i>." M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>.
H<span class="smcap lowercase">ICKSON</span>, too (No. 51.), affirms that "<i>drink up</i> is synonymous with
<i>drink off</i>, <i>drink to the dregs</i>," and observes that "a child taking
medicine is urged to <i>drink it up</i>. But H. K. S. C., or Mr. H. K. S.
C<span class="smcap lowercase">AUSTON</span>, as he afterwards signs himself, denies that <i>drink up</i> can be
used of <i>eysell</i>, or any other liquid, unless a <i>definite quantity</i> of
it be signified; that is, you may say to any one, if you please, in
allusion to a <i>definite quantity of vinegar</i>, "Drink it up;" but if you
allude to <i>vinegar in general</i>, without limitation of quantity, you will
say merely, "Drink vinegar." So if you would ask your friend whether he
drinks wine or water, you would say, "Do you drink wine or water?" not
"Do you drink up wine or water?" which would be to ask him whether he
drinks up <i>all</i> the wine or water in the world, or at least <i>all the
definite quantities of either</i> that come within his reach. M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span>
professes not to understand this doctrine, and refers M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">AUSTON</span> to the
nursery rhyme:</p>

<div class="poem">
    <p>  "<i>Eat up</i> your cake, Jenny,</p>
      <p><i>Drink up</i> your wine,"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">"which," he says, "may perhaps afford him further apt illustration;"
but which supplies, M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">AUSTON</span> rejoins, only another example that
<i>drink up</i> is applied to definite quantity; a quantity which, in this
case, is "neither more nor less than the identical glass of wine which
Jenny had standing before her." The line in Shakspeare's 114th Sonnet
is, M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">AUSTON</span> adds, "a parallel passage." To <i>drink up</i>, therefore, he
concludes, must be used of "a noun implying <i>absolute entirety</i>, which
might be a river, but could not be grammatically applied to any
unexpressed quantity." In these remarks there seems to be great justness
of reasoning. M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>.
 C<span class="smcap lowercase">AUSTON</span> might also have instanced the lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
    <p>  "Freely welcome to my cup,</p>
 <p>     Couldst thou sip, and sip it up:"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">that is, "couldst thou <i>go on sipping</i> till thou hast <i>sipped up</i>, or
<i>entirely exhausted, the whole definite quantity</i> in the cup."</p>

<p>12. But M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span> in 1850, differing so much from Mr. Singer in 1826
(who thought that a river was signified), supposes that though a sort of
drink is intended, it is not <i>vinegar</i>, but <i>wormwood-wine</i>. To this
purpose he cites the lines of Shakspeare's 111th Sonnet, which we have
already transcribed:</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "Whilst like a willing patient I will drink</p>
     <p> Potions of <i>eysell</i> 'gainst my strong infection;</p>
     <p> No <i>bitterness</i> that I will bitter think</p>
      <p>Nor double penance to correct correction."</p>
</div>

<p>"Here we see," he observes, "that it was a <i>bitter potion</i> which it was
a penance to drink." This does not seem to be clearly apparent from the
passage for it is not absolutely certain that the <i>bitterness</i> in the
third line refers to the <i>eysell</i> in the second. But he adds another
quotation from the <i>Troy Boke</i> of Lydgate:</p>

<div class="poem"> <p>   "Of <i>bitter eysell</i>, and of eager wine."</p></div>

<p>After which he subjoins:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Numerous passages in our old dramatic writers show that it was a
   fashion with the gallants of the time to do some extravagant
   feat, <i>as a proof of their love</i>, in honour of their mistresses;
   and among others, the swallowing some nauseous potion was one of
   the most frequent: but vinegar would hardly have been considered
   in this light; <i>wormwood</i> might. In Thomas's <i>Italian
   Dictionary</i>, 1562, we have 'Assentio, <i>Eysell</i>;' and Florio
   renders that word [Assentio] by <i>Wormwood</i>. What is meant,
   however is <i>absinthites</i>, or <i>wormwood wine</i>, a nauseously bitter
   medicament then much in use; and this being evidently the <i>bitter
   potion</i> of <i>eysell</i> in the poet's sonnet, was certainly the
   nauseous draught proposed to be taken by Hamlet, among the other
   extravagant feats as tokens of love."</p>

<p>The reader will judge with what justice the words "evidently" and
"certainly" are used. M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span> then cites Junius, but to little
purpose; Hutton's <i>Dictionary</i>, to prove that <i>absinthites</i> meant
"wormwood-wine;" and Stuckius's <i>Antiquitates Convivales</i> to show that
absinthites was a <i>propoma</i>; but Stuckius, be it observed, mentions this
<i>propoma</i> only as a stomachic, <i>quod vim habet stomachum corroborandi et
extenuandi</i>.</p>

<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that L<span class="smcap lowercase">ORD</span> B<span class="smcap lowercase">RAYBROOKE</span> (Vol. ii., p.
286.) should quote against M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER'S</span> theory the following paragraph:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">   "If, as M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span> supposes, '<i>Eisell</i> was absinthites, or
   wormwood-wine, a nauseously bitter medicament then much in use,'
   Pepys's friends must have had a very singular taste, for he
   records on the 24th of November, 1660:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">'Creed, and Shepley, and I, to the Rhenish wine-house, and there
   I did give them two quarts of wormwood wine.'</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"Perhaps the beverage was doctored for the English market, and
   rendered more palatable than it had been in the days of
   Stuckius."</p>

<p>Two other correspondents of the "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" also, C. H. (Vol.
iii., p. 508.) and G<span class="smcap lowercase">OMER</span> (<i>ibid.</i>), assert that <i>eysell</i>, if it means
any potion at all, must mean vinegar; C. H. referring to a MS. at
Cambridge (Dd. i. fol. 7.), date about 1350, in which occurs,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
    <p>  "Þe iewis herde þis word wet alle</p>
    <p>  And anon <i>eysel</i> þei mengid wiþ galle:"</p>
</div>

<p>and G<span class="smcap lowercase">OMER</span> relying on the support of the Welsh word <i>Aesell</i>, which
implies verjuice or vinegar. D. R<span class="smcap lowercase">OCK</span>, too, adduces the 'Festival' in the
sermon for St. Michael's day:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"And other angellis with h&#299; (St. Michael) shall bring all the
   Instrum&#275;tis of our lordis passyon; the crosse; the crowne;
   spere; nayles; hamer; sponge; <i>eyseel</i>; gall, &amp;c."<a id="gall67"></a>
<span  class="pagenum">[67]</span></p>

<p>There is therefore, it appears, ample testimony to show that <i>eysell</i>
was used for <i>vinegar</i>; but to prove that it meant <i>wormwood-wine</i>, M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>.
S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER'S</span> instances seem insufficient.</p>

<p>13. Before we proceed further, let us, supposing that no bitter or sour
potion, but a river, is meant, advert to the consideration what river
may be intended? Theobald observed that there was no river of that name
in Denmark, nor any resembling it in name but "<i>Yssel</i>, from which the
province of Overyssel derives its name in the German Flanders."
Steevens, however, is well content to take this <i>Yssel</i> as that which
Hamlet had in his thoughts. "But," he adds, "in an old Latin account of
Denmark, and the neighbouring provinces, I find the names of several
rivers little differing from <i>Esil</i> or <i>Eisill</i> in spelling or
pronunciation. Such are the Essa, the Oesil, and some others.... The
poet," he further remarks, "might have written the Weisel; a
considerable river, which falls into the Baltic Ocean, and could not be
unknown to any prince in Denmark." M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span> of 1826 suggests that the
<i>Issel</i> is perhaps meant, but that the firth of <i>Iyze</i> is nearest to the
scene of action. M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. K<span class="smcap lowercase">NIGHT</span> has little doubt that the Yssell, Issell, or
Izel, the most northern branch of the Rhine, and that which is nearest
to Denmark, is signified.</p>

<p>M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. H<span class="smcap lowercase">ICKSON</span>, indeed, who favours
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER'S</span> wormwood-wine, says (Vol.
iii., p. 119.), that the word cannot mean a river, because the definite
article is omitted before it. But this is an assertion of very little
weight. H. K. S. C. (Vol. iii., p. 68.) very justly observes, that we
may as correctly say,&mdash;"Woul't drink up Thames?" without the article, as
"Woul't drink up Eisell?" without the article. Let M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. H<span class="smcap lowercase">ICKSON</span> call to
mind Milton's lines on English rivers:</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "And sullen Mole, that runneth underneath</p>
    <p>  And Severn swift, guilty of maiden's death,"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">ending with&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
   <p>  "And Medway smooth, and royal-tower'd Thame,"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and ask himself whether the names of rivers are not with perfect
propriety used without the article. Pope has&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
   <p>   "And sails far off, among the swans of Thames."</p>
</div>

<p>And is not Sir Thomas Hammer quite correct in expression, when he alters
the hemistich into "Wilt drink up <i>Nile</i>?" But to multiply examples on
such a point would be idle.</p>

<p>14. It is now to be considered whether, supposing that the word might
mean <i>a potion</i> (whether of <i>vinegar</i> or <i>wormwood</i>) or <i>a river</i>, the
potion or the river is the more applicable to the passage in which it
occurs. It cannot be denied that the whole passage is full of rant and
extravagance. Laertes begins to rant, and Hamlet answers him in a
similar strain:</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "Now pile your dust (says Laertes) upon quick and dead,</p>
     <p> Till of this flat a mountain you have made,</p>
     <p> T' o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head</p>
      <p>Of blue Olympus."</p>
</div>

<p>This is surely extravagant enough. Hamlet retorts, in correspondent
tone,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
        <p class="i9">            "What is he whose grief</p>
     <p> <i>Bears such an emphasis</i>? whose phrase of sorrow</p>
      <p><i>Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand</i></p>
     <p><i> Like wonder-wounded hearers</i>?"</p>
</div>

<p>Then comes the struggles in which they are parted by the attendants
after which Hamlet cries out with like "emphasis:"</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "Why I will fight with him upon this theme</p>
     <p> <i>Until my eye-lids can no longer wag</i>.</p>
     <p> ...</p>
     <p> I lov'd Ophelia; <i>forty thousand brothers</i></p>
    <p>  Could not, with all their quantity of love,</p>
     <p> Make up my sum&mdash;what wilt thou do for her?"</p>
</div>

<p>On which the king exclaims, with much reason,</p>

<div class="poem">
    <p>  "O, he is mad, Laertes."</p>
</div>

<p>Hamlet continues, as if to make his madness indisputable:</p>

<div class="poem">
             <p class="i5"> "Zounds! show me what thoul't do:</p>
     <p> Woul't weep? woul't fight? woul't fast? woul't tear thyself?</p>
     <p> Woul't drink up <i>Esil</i>? eat a crocodile?</p>
      <p>I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?</p>
      <p>To outface me with leaping in her grave?</p>
     <p> Be buried quick with her, and so will I:</p>
      <p>And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw</p>
    <p>  <i>Millions of acres on us</i>; till our ground,</p>
      <p><i>Singeing his pate against the burning zone</i>,</p>
      <p><i>Make Ossa like a wart</i>! <i>Nay, an thoul't mouth</i>,</p>
     <p> <i>I'll rant as well as thou</i>."</p>
</div>

<p>The queen justly observes:</p>

  <div class="poem">
 <p>   "This is <i>mere madness</i>."</p>
</div>

<p>Hamlet goes off, but maintains his extravagance of language to the last:</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p>"Let Hercules himself do what he may,</p>
      <p>The cat will mew, and dog will have his day."</p>
</div>

<p>If, then, a literary jury be required to decide this question, the point
on which they have to give a verdict is, whether <i>to drink vinegar</i> (or
wormwood-wine) or <i>to drink up a river</i> is more in consonance with the
tenor of Hamlet's speech. Theobald indeed says, that "Hamlet is not
proposing any <i>impossibilities</i> to Laertes, such as drinking up a river
would be, but rather seems to mean, Wilt thou resolve to do <i>things the
most shocking and distasteful to human nature</i>?" But on what ground does
this assertion rest? Laertes himself commences with what we may surely
call an impossibility:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <p>   "Till of this flat," &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>And Hamlet speaks of more impossibilities, when he talks of throwing up
"millions of acres," to<a id="to68"></a>
<span  class="pagenum">[68]</span> "make Ossa like a wart." The drinking up
a river is certainly more in unison with these extravagant proposals
than a defiance "to swallow down (as Theobald has it) large draughts of
vinegar;" or, as Malone gives it, "to drink a potion of vinegar." Such a
proposition, Theobald admits, "is not very grand;" "a challenge to
hazard a fit of the heartburn or the colic, is," says Steevens, "not
very magnificent." But it is not only far from "grand" and
"magnificent," but, what is worse, it is utterly tame and spiritless, in
a place where anything but tameness is wanted, and where it is, quite
out of keeping with the rest of the speech. M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. H<span class="smcap lowercase">ICKSON</span>, it is true,
says (Vol. ii, p. 329.), that "the notion of drinking up a river would
be quite unmeaning and out of place;" but this assertion is as
groundless as Theobald's, and is somewhat surprising from a gentleman
who exhorts those who would be critics "to master the grammatical
construction of a passage, deducing therefrom its general sense," and,
we may presume, its <i>general drift</i>, "before they attempt to fix the
meaning of a doubtful word." Had M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. H<span class="smcap lowercase">ICKSON</span> looked to the <i>general
drift</i> of this passage, before he attempted to fix the meaning of
<i>eisell</i>, or to concur with MR. SINGER of 1850 in his attempt to fix it,
he would, we may suppose, have been less ready to pronounce the notion
of drinking up a river <i>out of place</i>. It would have been better for him
to have adhered to the judgment of Archdeacon Nares, as cited by MR.
SINGER (Vol. ii., p. 241.):&mdash;"The challenge to drink <i>vinegar</i>, in such
a rant," says the Archdeacon, "is so inconsistent, and even ridiculous,
that we must decide for the <i>river</i>, whether its name be exactly found
or not. To drink up a river, and eat a crocodile with his impenetrable
scales, are two things equally impossible. There is no kind of
comparison between the others."</p>

<p>15. Though examples of similar rant are quite unnecessary to support
this opinion, let us nevertheless conclude by noticing those which the
critics have adduced on this passage:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "This sort of hyperbole," says Malone, in his second edition,
   "was common among our ancient poets. So, in Eastward Hoe, 1609:</p>

<div class="poem">
    <p>  'Come drink up Rhine, Thames, and Meander, dry.'.</p>
</div>

  <p class="blockquot"> "So also in Greene's <i>Orlando Furioso</i>, 1599:</p>

<div class="poem">
    <p>  'Else would I set my mouth to Tigris' streames,</p>
      <p>And drink up overflowing Euphrates.'</p>
</div>

 <p class="blockquot">  "Again, in Marlowe's <i>Jew of Malta</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> 'As sooner shalt thou drink the ocean dry,</p>
    <p>  Than conquer Malta.'"</p>
</div>

<p>To which Boswell adds:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Our author has a similar exaggeration in <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>,
   Act III. Scene 2.:
</p>

     <div class="poem">
 <p>'When we (<i>i. e.</i> lovers) vow to weep seas, live in fire, eat
     rocks, tame tigers,' &amp;c.</p>
</div>

  <p class="blockquot"> "In Chaucer's <i>Romaunt of the Rose</i>, we find the following lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> 'He underfongeth a grete paine,</p>
     <p> That undertaketh to drink up Seine.'"</p>
</div>

<p>Steevens notices <i>King Richard II.</i>, Act II Scene 2.:</p>

<div class="poem">
         <p class="i3"> "The task he undertakes,</p>
    <p>  Is numb'ring sands, and <i>drinking oceans dry</i>."</p>
</div>

<p>But enough. The majority of readers, like the majority of critics, will
surely be for the river, in the proportion of at least six to two.

<p><i>Eisell&mdash;Wormwood&mdash;Scurvy Ale.</i>&mdash;Such of your readers who have not yet
made up their minds whether "eisell" and "wormwood" are identical, will
not object to be reminded that Taylor, the Water Poet, in his <i>Pennyless
Pilgrimage</i>, describing his hospitable reception at Manchester, when
speaking of the liquid cheer supplied to him, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "... Eight several sorts of ale we had</p>
     <p>All able to make one stark drunk, or mad.</p>
     <p>  ...</p>
     <p> We had at one time set upon the table</p>
     <p> Good ale of hyssop ('twas no Æsop fable);</p>
     <p> Then had we ale of sage, and ale of malt</p>
     <p>And ale of <i>wormwood</i> that could make one halt</p>
     <p> With ale of rosemary, and of bettony,</p>
     <p> And two ales more, or else I needs must lie.</p>
     <p> But to conclude this drinking aley tale</p>
     <p> We had a sort of ale called scurvy ale."</p>
</div>

<p>It would seem that in most of these drinks, the chief object was to
impart an exciting but not disagreeable bitterness to the beverage,
groping as it were, by instinct, after that enduring and gratifying
bitter now universally derived from the hop. Wormwood, hyssop, rosemary,
sage, bettony, each furnished its peculiar temptation to the Manchester
drinkers, who some two centuries ago wanted an "excuse for the glass."
Can any of your correspondents state what were the components of the
<i>scurvy ale</i> spoken of by Taylor? This was, perhaps, a really medicated
drink.</p>

<p>It may not be generally known, that even at this day, In some of the gin

<h3><span>ROYAL LIBRARY.<br />
(Vol. iii., p. 427.)</span></h3>

<p>In the following passage (extracted from the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, No.
CLXXV., Dec. 1850, p. 143.) it is declared that the nation <i>did</i> "pay"
for this "munificent present." The writer is understood to be Mr. R.
Ford; and if his statement is not refuted, the business will henceforth
take its place as a sale which the nation was duped into regarding as a
gift:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
   "The secret history," says the reviewer, "was this: King George
   IV., having some pressing call for money, did not decline a
   proposition for selling the library to the Emperor of Russia. Mr.
   <i>Heber</i>, having ascertained that the books were actually booked
   for the Baltic, went to Lord <i>Sidmouth</i>, then Home Secretary, and
   stated the case; observing what a shame it would be that such a
   collection should go out of the country: to which Lord Sidmouth
   replied: 'Mr. Heber, it shall not!'&mdash;and it did not. On the
   remonstrance of Lord Sidmouth, of whose manly and straightforward
   character George IV. was very properly in awe, the last of the
   <i>grands monarques presented</i> the books to the British Museum, <i>on
   the condition</i> that the value of the rubles they were to have
   fetched should be somehow or other made good to him by ministers
   in pounds sterling. This was done out of the surplus of certain
   funds furnished by France for the compensation of losses by the
   Revolution. But his ministers, on a hint from the House of
   Commons that it was necessary to refund those monies, had
   recourse, we are told, to the droits of the Admiralty."</p>

<p>So that the books were not given, but paid for, out of public monies:
which ministers could not have made the object of a bargain, had they
been the king's, and not the nation's. And the inscription in the
Museum&mdash;like many others&mdash;"lifts its head and lies," <i>i. e.</i> unless the
<i>Quarterly Review</i> has been inventing a story, instead of telling a true
bit of secret history, decidedly worth noting if true.</p>


    <p class="right">  V.</p>



<p class="blockquot">[We believe the Quarterly Reviewer has been misinformed as to the facts
connected with the transfer of the Royal Library to the British Museum.
We have reason to know that George IV., being unwilling to continue the
expense of maintaining the Library, which he claimed to treat, not as a
heirloom of the crown, but as his own private inheritance, entertained a
proposal for its purchase from the Russian Government. This having come
to the knowledge of Lord Liverpool (through Dibdin, from Lady Spencer,
to whom it had been mentioned by the Princess Lieven), the projected
sale was, on the remonstrance of the Minister, abandoned, and the
Library presented to the nation. The King thus got rid of the annual
expenses; and although we do not believe that any bargain was made upon
the subject, it is not unlikely that the Ministry felt that this
surrender of the Library to the country gave the King some claim to
assistance towards the liquidation of his debts, and that such
assistance was accordingly furnished. Even if this were so, though the
result might be the same, the transaction is a very different one from
the direct bargain and sale described in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>.]
</p>

<p>In justice to Kind George IV., the letter which he addressed to the late
Earl of Liverpool, on <i>presenting</i> the books to his own subjects, should
be printed in your columns. I saw the autograph letter soon after it was
written, and a copy of it would be very easily met with.</p>

<p>Would it not have been both desirable and very advantageous, to have
converted the banqueting room at Whitehall into a receptacle for this
magnificent collection, which would doubtless have been augmented from
time to time?</p>

<p>Instead of concentrating such vast literary treasures at the Museum,
might it not have been expedient to diffuse them partially over this
immense metropolis?</p>

<p>To Peers and M.&nbsp;P.'s, especially, a fine library at Whitehall would be a
great boon. The present chapel was never consecrated, and its beautiful
ceiling is little suited to a house of prayer.</p>

<h3><span>THE CAXTON MEMORIAL.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 33.)</span></h3>

<p>For the information of your correspondent M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">OLTON</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY</span>, I beg to
inform him that there was an intermediate meeting of the subscribers to
the Caxton Memorial at the house of the Society of Arts between the
first meeting to which he alludes, and the last, held at the same place
the other day. Over that meeting I had the honour of presiding, and it
was determined to persevere in the object of erecting a statue in
Westminster to the memory of the first English printer; but the report
of the last meeting shows that the funds have not been so largely
contributed as might have been expected, and are now far short of the
sum, 500<i>l.</i>, required for the erection of an iron statue of the
illustrious typographer. True it is that no authentic portrait of Caxton
is known, but the truthful picture by Maclise might very well supply the
deficiency; and I see the engraving to be made from that painting rather
ostentatiously advertised as "the Caxton Memorial." The original design
of the Dean of St. Paul's, for "a fountain by day, and a light by
night," was abandoned as more poetical than practical; my chief
apprehension being either that the gas would spoil the water, or that
the water would put out the light. The statue was therefore resolved
upon as less costly and more appropriate than the fountain.</p>

<p>The statue of Gutenberg at Mentz is a good example of what might be
erected in Westminster; yet I very much doubt whether any likeness of
the<a id="likeness70"></a>
<span  class="pagenum">[70]</span> great printer has been preserved. The expense necessarily
attendant upon MR. CORNEY'S Literary Memorial appears to me to be fatal
to its success; for, however dear to the bibliographer, I fear but
little public interest is now felt in the writings of Caxton. The
<i>Typographical Antiquities</i> contain copious extracts from his works; and
the biographies of Lewis and Knight appear to have satisfied public
curiosity as to his life. Besides, a memorial of this nature would be
hidden in a bookcase, not seen in a highway. I may add that the present
state of the Caxton Memorial is this: the venerable Dean of St. Paul's
is anxious to be relieved from the charge of the funds already
subscribed, and to place them in the hands of the Society of Arts, if
that body will receive them, and undertake to promote the object of the
original subscribers by all the means at its command.</p>

<h3><span>MEANING OF "NERVOUS".<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 7.)</span></h3>

<p>Medically, the word <i>nervous</i> has the following meanings:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Of or belonging to the anatomical substance called nerve, <i>e. g.</i> the
"nervous system," "nervous sheaths," "nervous particles," &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. A predomination of the nervous system, when it is unusually active or
highly developed, which is what we mean in speaking of a "nervous
temperament," "a nervous person," &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. Certain functional disorders of the nervous system are so termed, and
in this sense we speak of "nervous people," "nervous complaints," and so
forth.</p>

<p>4. Nervous is also used, more poetically than correctly, to signify
<i>muscular</i>, and as synonymous with brawny, sinewy, &amp;c., thus conveying
an idea of strength and vigour. But <i>nerve</i> is not <i>muscle</i>, therefore
this inaccurate use of the word, though sanctioned by some good old
writers, must cease.</p>

<p>5. Nervous, in speaking of a part of the body, signifies a part in which
there are many nerves, or much nervous matter, or which is endowed with
extra sensibility.</p>

<p>These are the various ideas commonly attached to the word <i>nervous</i>.
They are too many for the word to be a closely accurate one, but we must
take them, not make them. We can, however, avoid the future inaccurate
use of the term alluded to in explanation 4., and all the metaphorical
derivations thereof, such as a "nervous style of writing," &amp;c., and
adhere to those two significations which are physiologically and
pathologically correct, and which are obviously derivable from the
several meanings and explanations above enumerated, viz.&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Of or belonging to the natural structure or functions of nerve; and</p>

<p>2. The quality of functional disorder or weakness of the nervous system
in certain respects.</p>

<p class="right">    W<span class="smcap lowercase">ILLIAM</span> E. C. N<span class="smcap lowercase">OURSE</span>.</p>


<p>Every one knows that instances of <i>catachresis</i> occur in all languages;
but I think this case may be more satisfactorily explained by
considering that the <i>nerves</i> consist of two very distinct and
independent classes of organs&mdash;nerves of sensation, which conduct
impressions to the sensorium; and nerves of volition, which convey the
mental impulse to the muscles. From this it necessarily follows that
when the former class are <i>over-active</i> (and <i>redundancy</i> is decidedly
the adjectival idea in the word <i>nervous</i>), a morbid excitability of
temper, with a perturbable anxious state of mind are produced (making
the "bad" sense of the word); while from a similar state of the nerves
of volition results a powerful and vigorous system of muscular action
and mental energy (making the "good" sense of the word).</p>

<h3><span>THE DUKE OF MONMOUTH'S POCKET-BOOKS.<br />
(Vol. i., p. 198.; Vol. iv., p. 1.)</span></h3>

<p>I am anxious to acknowledge that S<span class="smcap lowercase">IR</span> F. M<span class="smcap lowercase">ADDEN</span> has established, beyond
all doubt, the facts that <i>several</i> manuscript books were found on the
Duke of Monmouth when he was captured, and that the volume rescued from
oblivion by Dr. Anster, and now placed in the British Museum, is one of
these, and also in Monmouth's handwriting. I take this opportunity of
saying, that I, unfortunately, have not seen Dr. Anster's reply to my
communication; and it is to be regretted that it was not copied from the
<i>Dublin University Magazine</i> into "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>," so that we (the
readers of "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>") might have had the whole subject before
us. This is a course which I think our kind Editor may usefully adopt on
similar occasions.</p>

<p>Referring unsuccessfully to Lowndes' <i>Manual</i> for an answer to S<span class="smcap lowercase">IR</span> F.
M<span class="smcap lowercase">ADDEN'S</span> question as to the date of the first edition of Welwood's
<i>Memoirs</i>, I was pleased, however, to find that my edition (the sixth,
published in 1718) possesses a value which does not attach to previous
editions, inasmuch as it contains "A short introduction, giving an
account how these memoirs came at first to be writ." From this it
appears that there are spurious editions of the work, for Welwood
writes:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "I have given my bookseller leave to make a sixth impression of
   the following memoirs; and the [rather] that some time ago one
   Baker printed more than one edition of them without my knowledge,
   very incorrect, and on bad paper."</p>

<p>We may fairly assume, that the first edition was published at the
beginning of 1699, for [the] "epistle dedicatory" to King William is
dated<a id="dated71"></a>
<span  class="pagenum">[71]</span> February of that year. If this be so, it must be taken as
a proof of extraordinary popularity that the work should have reached a
third edition as early as 1700, as stated by S<span class="smcap lowercase">IR</span> F. M<span class="smcap lowercase">ADDEN</span>. The "account
how these memoirs came at first to be writ" possesses some interest. It
appears that Queen Mary used to hold frequent converse with the Doctor
on the subject of her great-grandfather's and grandfather's history,
and&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "At last she fell to regret the insuperable difficulties she lay
   under (for I well remember that was her mind) of knowing truly
   the history of her grandfather's reign; saying that most of the
   accounts she had read of it were either panegyrick or satire, not
   history. Then with an inimitable grace she told me, 'If I would
   in a few sheets give her a short sketch of the affairs of that
   reign, and of the causes that produced such dreadful effects, she
   would take it well of me.' Such commands were too sacred not to
   be obeyed; and when I was retiring from her presence, she stopt
   me to tell me she expected I would do what she had desired of me
   in such a manner, and with that freedom, as if I designed it for
   the information of a friend, and not one of the blood of King
   Charles I., promising to show it to none living without my
   consent."</p>

<p>Welwood further states, that after Mary's death, King William&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Sent me, by the late Earl of Portland, the manuscript I had
   given his Queen, found in her cabinet; where, upon the back of
   it, she had writ with her own hand the promise she had made me of
   showing it to nobody without my consent."</p>

<p>In addition to the extract from Monmouth's <i>Diary</i> given in my former
communication, Welwood publishes a letter of the Duke's to the brave and
true Argyle, which is perhaps more creditable to Monmouth than any other
memorial he has left. The letter, as Welwood suggests, appears to have
been written shortly after the death of Charles II. I copy it; but if
you think this paper too long, omit it:&mdash;</p>


   <p class="blockquot">"I received both yours together this morning, and cannot delay
   you my answer longer than this post though I am afraid it will
   not please you so much as I heartily wish it may. I have weighed
   all your reasons, and everything that you and my other friends
   have writ me upon that subject; and have done it with the
   greatest inclination to follow your advice, and without
   prejudice. You may well believe I have had time enough to reflect
   sufficiently upon our present state, especially since I came
   hither. But whatever way I turn my thoughts, I find insuperable
   difficulties. Pray do not think it an effect of melancholy, for
   that was never my greatest fault, when I tell you that in these

<h4><span><i>Dies Iræ, Dies Illa</i></span> <span>(Vol. ii p. 72. Vol. iii., p. 468.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash; Although some time has elapsed since the Query on this hymn appeared, yet as no very
definite reply has been given, I send the following.</p>

<p>This hymn is one of the four "proses" or verses<a id="verses72"></a>
<span  class="pagenum">[72]</span> without measure,
made use of in the services of the Roman Catholic Church. The invention
of these proses is attributed to Nolker, a monk of the Convent of St.
Gall, who wrote about the year 880; and who says in his work that he had
seen them in a book belonging to the Convent of St. Jumièges, which was
destroyed by the Normans in 841. Of the many proses which were composed,
the Roman Catholic Church has retained but four, of which the above is
one. Who the author really was, is very uncertain; the majority of
writers on the subject appear to concur in the opinion that Cardinal
Frangipani, a Dominican, otherwise called Malabrancia, a Doctor of
Paris, and who died at Pérouse in 1294, was the composer but it has also
been assigned to St. Gregory and St. Bernard. Bzovius, an. 1294, states
the author to have been either Cardinal Orsino or Cardinal Frangipani,
and other writers maintain it to have been the production of Agostino
Biella, who died 1491; or of Humbertus, General of the Dominicans. The
original consists of fifty-six lines, and may be found in almost every
book of Catholic devotion.</p>

<p class="right">   R.R.M.</p>

<p>In No. 84, for June 9th, the Roman Catholic hymn "Dies Iræ" is referred
to, and works cited as to its author. To these may be added the 39th No.
of the <i>Dublin Review</i>, where it will be found that Latino Frangipani,
nephew of Pope Nicholas III., and known under the name of the Cardinal
Malabrancia, was more generally considered the writer. The account there
given of it is not uninteresting, and is preceded by a cursory
advertence to the other hymns of the Middle Ages, including a Greek
version of some of the stanzas of Thomas Aquinas, the "Angelic
Doctor's," impressive "Lauda Sion."</p>

<h4><span><i>Sardonic Smiles</i> </span><span>(Vol. iv., p. 18.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;It is very difficult to strike
out the verse in Homer's Odyssey
(<ins title="[Greek: Y]">&#933;</ins>, 302.). To suppose that in
him the word is derived from Sardinia, is exceedingly improbable, if
not, as Payne Knight says, quite absurd because, not only is Sardinia
not mentioned in Homer, but his geography, even where half-fabulous, and
with other names than the modern ones, does not extend so far west.
Payne Knight says the word is derived from
 <ins title="[Greek: sardainô]">&#963;&#945;&#961;&#948;&#945;&#8055;&#957;&#969;</ins>, but where
such a word is found I cannot learn. There is
<ins title="[Greek: sardazô]">&#963;&#945;&#961;&#948;&#8049;&#950;&#969;</ins> in
Suidas, "to laugh bitterly," but unluckily the very same words are given
as the interpretation of
<ins title="[Greek: sarkazô]">&#963;&#945;&#961;&#954;&#8049;&#950;&#969;</ins>, and
<ins title="[Greek: sarkazô]">&#963;&#945;&#961;&#954;&#8049;&#950;&#969;</ins> is a
perfectly established word. <i>Sarcasm, sarcastic</i>, are derived from it;
and its own derivation from
<ins title="[Greek: sarx]">&#963;&#8049;&#961;&#958;</ins> "flesh," seems certain. This
makes it highly probable that the first word in Suidas is a mistake for
the other. All Greek writers borrowed so much from Homer that the
occurrence of the word in them, where obviously<a id="where73"></a>
<span  class="pagenum">[73]</span> meaning
Sardinian, seems to prove nothing but that they thought it had that
meaning in him.</p>

<p>  'Ci gît l'enfant gâté du monde qu'il gâta,'</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">been ascertained?" It has; and the lady was Madame la Baronne de
Montolieu, who wrote a great variety of novels, of which by far the
best, and indeed one of the most interesting in the French language, is
her <i>Caroline de Lichtfield</i>, first published at Lausanne in 1786, two
volumes 8vo. Her family name was de Bottens (Pauline-Isabelle), born at
Lausanne in 1751, and there died in December, 1832. Her first husband
was Benjamin de Crouzas, son to one of Montesquieu's adversaries, after
whose death she married the Baron de Montolieu. It was Gibbon's most
intimate friend and literary <i>collaborateur</i>, Deyverdun, who published,
and indeed corrected, her then anonymous <i>Caroline de Lichtfield</i>.</p>

<p>Voltaire's friend and mistress, the learned Madame du Châtelet, had
prepared an inscription for his portrait, which may be considered an
anticipated epitaph:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <p>    "Post-genitis Hic canis erit, nunc canis amicis;"</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">but one of a very different tenor was written by J. J. Rousseau, we are
told by Lord Brougham:</p>

<h4><span><i>Voltaire, where situated</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii, pp. 329.433.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The inquiry,
"Where is Voltaire situated?" was answered in a late number, and
reference made to the <i>Essays of an Octogenarian</i>, a privately-printed
work, and therefore not generally accessible; but the subject will be
equally found elucidated in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for July, 1846,
p. 25. No such place ever existed, as there made clear; for it is the
simple anagram of his patronymic, Arouet l j (<i>le jeune</i>), framed by
himself though by Condorcet and other biographers, ignorant of the fact,
supposed to be a landed property. Voltaire loved not his paternal name,
as will be there found, and gladly changed it. The article embraces
various particulars of Voltaire's life, in refutation of Lord Brougham's
errors; some of them strange enough, and not inconsiderable in number,
so as to excite surprise in so accomplished a person.</p>

<p>&mdash;I think there can be
little doubt that the "Robert Passellew" of Waltham Abbey, and "John
Paslew," the last abbot of Whalley, belong to the same family. A
reference to Burke's <i>General Armory</i> proves the armorial bearings to be
the same, and also that the family was connected with the county of
Durham. The following extract from the <i>Historical, Antiquarian, and
Picturesque Account of Kirkstall Abbey</i> (Longmans, 1827), will show that
a century later the Paslews had obtained a footing in Yorkshire, and had
become benefactors of Kirkstall:</p>

<p>&mdash;Touching this subject
I can state that I am well acquainted with an admirable portrait of the
poet, bearing date 1593, in which he is represented as a man of not more

said to have died prematurely&mdash;<i>immaturâ morte obiisse</i>, as the monument

<h4><span><i>Blessing by the Hand</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., pp. 477. 509.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The priest of the
Greek church, in blessing with the hand, anciently held it with the
thumb crossing the third finger, the first finger being held straight,
the second and fourth curved, so as to represent altogether the Greek
letters I C X C, the first and last letters of "Jesus Christ." The same
letters are impressed on the bread used in their eucharist, the bread
being marked with the Greek cross, similar to our cross-buns, with the
letters I C and X C in the upper angles of the cross, and the letters N
and K in the two lower angles. The N K is the abbreviation of
<ins title="[Greek: nika]">&#957;&#8055;&#954;&#8115;</ins>, and the whole phrase is "Jesus Christ conquers." This church
derived the expression from the standard (labarum) of Constantine,
<ins title="[Greek: en toutô nika]">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8059;&#964;&#8179; &#957;&#8055;&#954;&#8115;</ins>
 = <i>in hoc signo vinces</i>. In Goar's notes on the
Greek rituals, especially that of Chrysostom's, much information may be
obtained on the symbolisms of Christianity.</p>

composed, viz. the suppression of the rebellion in 1745. It was
published by Tonson in Feb. 1746, at the price of 1<i>s.</i>, together with
various poems, &amp;c. relating to the same important event. The Oratorio is

the airs, and two of the choruses, it contains little that can be
popular at the present day.</p>

February 4, 1744, and died at Royston, Herts, January 26, 1820. Andrews
was astronomical calculator to the Board of Longitude, and for years
corresponded with Maskelyne and other eminent men. A portrait of Andrews
is extant; one is in my possession: they are now extremely scarce.</p>

<p>As to the date of the almanack's first appearance I can afford no
information; but it can be obtained of Mr. W. H. Andrews, only son of
the astronomer, who still resides at Royston, and is in possession of

<p>The leading idea in the term <i>Bomerie</i>, and its English equivalent, when
applied to borrowing money "on a ship's keel," is the hazarding all on a
single venture: hence it is not difficult to see its application to
other transactions, especially those connected with sea; such as
wholesale purchases of fish, in which a large risk is run, with an
uncertain prospect of return.</p>

<p>The meaning of the word, if it be really the same, when adopted by
confectioners, would probably be assignable either to the shape of the
pans, or the use to which they were applied.</p>

<p>I know not whether this is to be classed among the "unsatisfactory"
derivations already submitted to your correspondent, but should be glad
to hear his opinion on its soundness.</p>

<span  class="pagenum">[75]</span> he
ought to have done), he would have seen that it is expressly mentioned
(p. 51.) that Sheridan, having become part proprietor of Drury Lane
Theatre&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "His first commencement as a manager was not of that brilliant
   kind to give any promise of great improvement in the conduct of
   the theatre. <i>An alteration</i> of Vanbrugh's play the <i>Relapse</i> was
   the first production, under the name of a <i>Trip to Scarborough</i>.
   It was brought out on February 24, 1777. This was an unfortunate
   commencement: neither the public nor the actors were satisfied."</p>

<p>Further, it is printed at the end of Sheridan's <i>Dramatic Works</i>,
followed by <i>Pizarro</i>, printed in smaller type, so as to make them
appear like an appendix; and hence it could hardly be expected that any
one would think of attributing the <i>Trip to Scarborough</i>, altered from
Vanbrugh's <i>Relapse</i>, to Sheridan, any more than it could be considered
as intended to call him the author of <i>Pizarro</i>, because he altered
Kotzebue's <i>Spaniards in Peru</i>, and adapted it to, and had it
represented on, the stage.</p>

<h4><span><i>Frogs in Ireland&mdash;Round Towers</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., pp. 353. 428. 490.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I
must take leave to doubt the fact, mentioned in Vol. iii., p. 490., of
the introduction of frogs into Ireland first in the year 1696. They are
much too plentiful in the country districts, leaving out their abundance
in the county Dublin, to warrant any such supposition. In the Queen's
County, particularly, I have seen them in myriads. With regard to those
gentlemen who are pleased to import snakes into Ireland, I can only wish
them some worthier occupation.</p>

<p>There are two birds, the occurrence of which about Dublin I do not find
noticed by naturalists. One is the common skylark, the other is the
Royston crow, which, strange to say, is not a migratory visitor, but is
found there the whole year round.</p>

<p>Concerning Round Towers, mentioned at pages 353. and 428., I beg to
refer W. R. M. to the works of Wilkinson, Mr. and Mrs. S. C. Hall, and
Moore's <i>History of Ireland</i>, in addition to Petrie, Keating, &amp;c. When
in Galway, in January, 1850, I noticed some remarkable instances of
resemblance to Spaniards amongst the peasant women and girls. It was,
however, by no means general; but only observable here and there, in a
few particular instances. Between Galway and Oughterard I passed a girl
walking barefooted along the dirty road, whose features were strikingly
beautiful, set off with long raven tresses and large <i>dark</i> eyes, signs
apparently of her Spanish origin. The town of Galway is full of
interesting memorials of its connexion with Spain, and well repays a
visit. Its ancient prosperity will now be probably revived<a id="revived76"></a>
<span  class="pagenum">[76]</span>
again, and, with its singularly advantageous position, and its future
intercourse with America, it cannot fail to rise once more from its
ruins and its dirt, unless prevented by the prevalence of political
agitation.</p>

<h4><span><i>Meaning of Hernshaw</i> </span><span>(Vol. iii., p. 450.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In Poulson's <i>Beverlac; or
History of the Antiquities of Beverley in Yorkshire</i>, pp. 263, 264. et
seq., is an account of the expenses of the "Twelve Governors of Beverley
on a visit to the Earl of Northumberland at Leconfield Castle." Among
the presents made to the Earl (Henry Algernon Percy, fifth earl, born
Jan. 1477-8, died 1527) for so distinguished an honour are four
heronsewes, heronseu, hornsue, or <i>hernshaw</i>, for it is written in all
these ways. Was a young heron formerly esteemed a choice delicacy?
Chaucer, describing the feast of Cambisscan, says:</p>

<div class="poem">
    <p>  "I wol not tellen of hir strange sewes,</p>
      <p>Ne hir swannes, ne hir heronsewes."</p>
</div>

<p>But even the full-grown bird was not too powerful for the digestive
organs in those days: it was termed <i>viand royal</i>, and heronries were
maintained for the purpose of food, as well as diversion. In the
Northumberland Household Book, these birds, with many others, are named
as then served up at table, but which are now discarded as little better
than carrion.</p>

<p>From <i>hernshaw</i>, still further corrupted, arose the proverbial
expression introduced by Shakspeare into <i>Hamlet</i>,&mdash;</p>

ancient sound given to the word <i>Coke</i>. <i>Cowper</i> is a similar instance:
I believe it has always been called <i>Cooper</i>. In an old electioneering
squib by the late Lord John Townshend, <i>Cowper</i> is made to rhyme to
<i>Trooper</i>. The passage alludes to an old county scandal, and I do not
therefore quote it.</p>

<p class="right">   J. H. L.</p>


<p>There can be no doubt (as it seems to me) that the poet's name <i>ought</i>
to be pronounced according to the spelling. I am enabled to state
decidedly that he himself pronounced his name <i>Cowper</i>, and <i>not
Cooper</i>. I venture to think that the same might also be said with
respect to Lord Coke's name; <i>i. e.</i> that the pronunciation Cook is only
a "modern affectation."</p>

<p>&mdash;In reply to the question of your correspondent W. P., I beg
to inform him that the custom originated from that period of our history
when the Dutch admiral, Van Tromp, with his fleet appeared on our coasts
in hostility against England. The broom was hoisted as indicative of his
intention to sweep the ships of England from the sea. To repel this
insolence the English admiral hoisted a horse-whip, equally indicative
of his intention to chastise the Dutchman. The pennant which the
horse-whip symbolised has ever since been the distinguishing mark of
English ships of war.</p>

<h4><span><i>Basnet Family</i></span><span> (Vol. iii., p. 495.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I can perhaps give D. X. some information respecting the ancient family of Basnet, being related to
them through my mother.</p>

<p>From papers in our possession, we have always considered ourselves
descended from Edward Basnet, the first married Dean of St. Patrick's;
and I drew up a pedigree of the family, which is in Berry's <i>Berkshire</i>.
But the <i>proofs</i> only go as far as Thomas Basnet, of Coventry, born in
1590. Lawrance Basset, otherwise Bassnet, of Bainton, in the fee of the
hundred of Hatton, in the parish of Budworth, in the palatine of
Chester, living in the 27th of Henry VIII., anno 1536, was descended of
a younger house of Sir Philip Basset, knight, &amp;c. of St. Hillane, in the
county of Glamorgan. He had Piers Basnet, of Bainton aforesaid, lived in
the time of Henry VIII., anno 1547, purchased land in Bainton of Edward
Starkie, of Simondston in Lancashire, married Ann, dau. of Robert Eaton,
of Over Whitley, first wife, by whom he had two sons, Thomas and Henry.
The second wife was dau. of &mdash;&mdash; Stretch, of Leigh, had one son Robert,
of the city of Chester.</p>

<p>The second son of Lawrance Basset, or Bassnet, was Hugh, of Leigh,
living temp. Henry VIII., anno 1543.</p>

<p>The third son was Thomas, temp. Henry VIII., 1539, whose son (we
suppose) was Edward Basnet, Dean of St. Patrick's whose grandson was an
ensign in General Monk's own regiment, the Coldstream Guards, 1660. He
left the regiment in 1665.</p>

<p>In the Egerton Papers, Camden Soc., vol. xii., is this account:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Amongst those appointed for the Privy Council for the better
   government of Ireland, in the year July 1550, was Edward Basnet,
   clerk, late Dean of St. Patrick's, Dublin."</p>

<p>The arms of the present family are Argent, a cheveron gules, between
three helmets, close ppr. Crest: an arm, embowed, in armour, holding a
cutlas, all proper.</p>

<p>By applying to Charles Basnett, Esq., No. 3. Brock Street, Bath, D. X.
may have a full account of this family.</p>

<h3><span>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</span></h3>


<p>As we last week called attention to the <i>Three Treatises by John
Wickliffe</i> just published by Dr. Todd of Dublin, we may very properly
record the sale by Messrs. Puttick and Simpson on Tuesday the 8th of
this month of a MS. volume containing twelve treatises (which are all
said to be unpublished) written by John Wickliffe and Richard Hampole.
The volume, a small 8vo., was of the fourteenth century, with a few
leaves supplied by a hand of the sixteenth, and contained "A Tretis on
the Ten Heestis (<i>i.e.</i> Commandments), A Prologue of the Paternoster,
'Here suen dyverse chapitris excitynge men to hevenli desijr,' the
Councell of Christ, Off vertuous pacience, Wickliffe's Chartre of
Hevene, The Hors or Armour off Hevene, the Name off Jhesu, The Love of
Jhesu, Off verri Mekenes, Off the Effect off Mannes Will, Of Actif Liif
and Contemplatif Lyf, The Mirrour of Chastitee." It was purchased by
Bumstead of Holborn for 11<i>l.</i> The next lot in the same sale was the
original manuscript Diary, extending from October, 1675, to September,
1684, of Annesley Earl of Anglesey, Lord Privy Seal in the reign of
Charles II., which was purchased by Boone, it is believed on<a id="Boone78"></a>

commission for the British Museum, for the sum of 12<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The <i>Athenæum</i> of Saturday last publishes some inquiries from Mr. Payne
Collier connected with the manuscript play by Anthony Mundy, which forms
the subject of SIR F. MADDEN'S interesting, communication in our present
number. Mr. Collier is about to edit the drama in question for the
Shakspeare Society; and the object of his paper, which well deserves the
attention of our readers, is to obtain information respecting two
wizards or magicians who figure in it, the one named John a Kent, and
the other John a Cumber, who must formerly have been popular heroes, and
been recorded in ballads and chapbooks which have now entirely
disappeared. We call attention to these inquiries with the view of
giving additional publicity to them, and in the hope of procuring from
Mr. Collier some Notes respecting these old world heroes, of one of
whom, John a Kent, some particulars are to be found, we believe, in
Coxe's <i>Monmouthshire</i>.</p>

<p>The obituary of the past week contains the name of one of the most
distinguished historical writers of the present day, the Rev. Dr.
Lingard. An able and zealous champion of the Church of which he was so
eminent a member, his tolerant spirit and independent principles show
that of Dr. Lingard may be said, what was applied with admirable
propriety to his co-religionist, the late learned librarian at Stowe, by
Sir James Macintosh, that he was</p>

<p>The sale of M. Donnadieu's valuable collection of Autographs will
commence on Tuesday next, and occupy five days. The Catalogue, which has
been prepared by Messrs. Puttick and Simpson with their usual care, is
itself a very interesting document. Our limits will not of course admit
of our specifying a tithe of the curious and valuable articles which are
now to be brought to the hammer: but as specimens of the richness of the
collection, we will point out a few which are of importance, as
illustrative of English history. Lot 165, for instance, is <i>Charles I.'s
Marriage Contract with the Infanta of Spain</i>, a document of the highest
value, but which has not, we believe, as yet been printed either
accurately or entirely. Lot 184 is a most interesting letter from
<i>Charles II. to his Sister the Duchess of Orleans</i>, written from
Canterbury the day after he landed at Dover; while Lot 661 is a most
pathetic <i>Letter from the Duke of Monmouth to the Earl of Rochester</i>,
entreating his intercession with James, and written five days before his
execution. Lot 254 is <i>The Original Warrant to the Lord Mayor of London,
directing him to proclaim Oliver Cromwell Lord Protector of the
Commonwealth of England, Scotland, Ireland, and the Dominions thereto
belonging</i>; and Lot 500, a <i>Warrant of the Privy Council of Lady Jane
Gray</i>, is a document of the highest importance, as proving (what has
been doubted) that the Council of Lady Jane Grey did actually perform
official acts as a Council. These of course are among the gems of the
collection; but in the whole thousand lots there is not one but is of
interest.</p>

Fellow of Trinity College, Professor of Hebrew in the University, and
Treasurer of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin.</p>

<p class="center">EXTRACTS FROM THE PROSPECTUS.</p>

<p>"The Tracts here collected are now, for the first time, printed. They
are interesting as being, perhaps, the latest of Wycklyffe's writings,
and as expressing, it may be presumed, his matured opinions and
judgement, on the important subjects of which they treat. One of them,
the Treatise <i>On the Church and its Members</i>, contains internal evidence
of having been composed within the last year of the Reformer's life: the
others, from their close connexion with this, in style and
subject-matter, were probably written at the same time."</p>

<p>"It is scarcely necessary to say that the Editor, in printing these
curious tracts, has no wish to recommend <i>all</i> the doctrines they
advocate. His object is to make them known as documents essential to the
right understanding of the attempt made by Wycklyffe and his followers
for the reformation of the Church. They are interesting also as
monuments of the state of the English language in the fourteenth
century, and they throw great light on the manners, customs, and
religion of our ancestors at that period.</p>

<p>"Some <i>Notes</i> have been added explanatory of obscure allusions, and with
verifications of the quotations from ancient writers, occurring in the
Text. A copious <i>Glossary</i> has also been compiled, to assist the reader
in understanding the obsolete words and spellings of the original.</p>

<p>"The Editor is not without a hope that the publication of these
Treatises may direct the attention of influential scholars to the
importance of collecting and printing, under the care of competent
Editors, all the existing writings which remain in our libraries, under
the name of Wycklyffe and his contemporaries. Until this is done, a most
important period of our ecclesiastical history must continue in
comparative obscurity."</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
